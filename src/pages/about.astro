        About Me

    </header>

    <h2>Current Role</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Principal Data Analyst at Capital One, where I work on turning complex data into
      actionable insights. My day-to-day involves a lot of SQL, a healthy amount of Python,
      and the occasional existential question about data architecture.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I've always been drawn to understanding how systems work—whether that's databases,
      organizations, or the patterns that emerge from human behavior. This curiosity led me
      to data analytics, where I get to ask questions and (sometimes) find answers hidden
      in the numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Capital One, I've worked across various industries, each time bringing a
      systems-thinking approach to data problems. I believe the best analysis comes from
      understanding not just the data, but the context it lives in.
    </p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> Understanding how parts connect to form wholes</li>
      <li><strong>Clarity over complexity:</strong> The best solution is usually the simplest one that works</li>
      <li><strong>Curiosity-driven:</strong> The most interesting insights come from asking "why" one more time</li>
      <li><strong>Visual communication:</strong> A good chart is worth a thousand rows of data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outside Work</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not querying databases, you might find me:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experimenting with AI and music</li>
      <li>Building tools to solve problems I probably could have just ignored</li>
      <li>Occasionally <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNNzlV3Our4/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">touching grass</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>
      I'm always happy to connect with fellow systems thinkers, data enthusiasts, or anyone
      who wants to chat about interesting problems. Feel free to reach out via
