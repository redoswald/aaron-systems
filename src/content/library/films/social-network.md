Sorkin's dialogue is a weapon. Fincher's direction is surgical. The opening scene at the bar is a masterclass in establishing character through conversation.

What strikes me on rewatches is how the film isn't really about Facebook or even Zuckerberg - it's about the loneliness of ambition, the way success can hollow you out even as it elevates you.

"You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be."
