Wow, unfortunately, this book really was sexist as hell. Also, unlike the other books, the main character largely reacts to things around them. There is no proactive decision making. There is just acquiescence to fate. It's dumb. The science is ok, but not nearly as interesting as that posed Three-Body Problem or The Dark Forest.

There are many points when the story could end and nothing would be lost, but instead, it keeps going without a breather. It feels like the story is running faster and faster... but from what? For what purpose? It is not clear.

Also, it ends with some lines about "love" like a pop action sci-fi flick! WHAT?!
