[Zinn's book ](https://amzn.to/2TgRLjp)could be split into two: "A History of American Atrocities and the People That Fought Them" which would be an exhilarating, if sobering, read about the violence that made America, America. The other section would be "Boring Chronology of Protests and Strikes without Context." When Zinn tries to describe different strikes and protest movements, he simply states the absolute numbers and absolute history. He doesn't set the context. For example, he describes a protest of 200 people in Boston (I think). Sure, that's great. But I see a protest of 200 people every single time I go to get Indian food in Washington, D.C. These protests never appear anywhere in popular culture afterward.

The first book would be better, shorter, and more powerful. The second would be a good Wikipedia page.
