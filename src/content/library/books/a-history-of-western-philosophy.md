[History of Western Philosophy](https://amzn.to/2B4wnXU) is huge tomb. It begins in the era of the Greeks and ends with Russell pronouncing that Analytic philosophy looks like it will dominate for some time to come. The history of Europe, and a bit of Muslim history, is outlined throughout the text, as Russel goes from philosopher to philosopher. Russells says at the beginning he is not trying to find the best of philosophers, he is trying to emphasize those that have had the most influence.

The chapters are generally (a) biographical/philosophical, or (b) historical/cultural or (c) some hybrid of both. Of the first kind, he outlines a philosophers' life. He then explains this persons' philosophy and tries to interpret them as concisely as possible. Of the second kind, he tries to explain why he isn't talking about any philosophers! For example, he doesn't really consider the Romans to have produced any philosopher of note, having adopted the Stoic/Cynic philosophical systems en masse. Of the third kind, he will rapidly progress through time creating several philo-biographies.

The only criticisms levied against him is that Russell, a philosopher himself, is biased. I think he does a good job at hiding and checking his bias up until after Kant. His review of Nietzsche is most scathing. Apologists for the German will point out two things: (1) that Russell had the copies of Nietzsche's works that were editted by his pro-Nazi sister, and that Russell hated the Nazis- they were bombing his house! and (2) there are some misinterpretations of the idea of "Will to Power". However, from my own experience with the modern followers of Nietzsche, Russell's criticisms remain right on target.
