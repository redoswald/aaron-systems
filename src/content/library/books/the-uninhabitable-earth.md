Zach and I looked down on the St. John's River. He had just woken up. The river was blue and white. The trees of the Southside were green. A walked dog barked.

"All of this will be underwater."

Don't get me wrong, Jacksonville will be the last great Floridian city to descend into the waves, but it will descend. One of the lessons -Wallace-Wells might not like the word lessons- of climate change is that change will happen mind-bogglingly slowly and quickly all at once. The hurricanes that lashed Florida and drowned the globe of Memorial Park will come soon as Category Sixes within our lifetimes, but the seas will continue to rise higher and higher farther and farther in the future.

I loved David Wallace-Wells' article in New York Magazine. The 7000 words had a simple structure: (1) The science is telling us that these are the effects of global warming and (2) why are scientists being so pusillanimous about sounding the alarm?

The book, "The Uninhabitable Earth" is largely an expansion of the depth for the first topic and a widening of scope for the second. Whereas DWW had a few words to tell us how heat waves will leave man laid low, now he had an entire chapter to describe how heat death actually works and who will feel it the worst (India will). Indeed, he has twelve terrifying chapters that go effect by effect by effect.

The latter part of the book doesn't look at just scientists as much as it looks at the stories that climate change has generated. He calls it the Climate Kaleidoscope. There are multiple ways of interpreting the data, but the data isn't just CO2 levels approaching 420 PPM, it's the ways we respond to climate change. This may sound lofty or corny but the question is real and important:

What does climate change imply about being human?

Your ideological and personal background color your answers and twist their shapes. If you're a neoliberal, Whiggish capitalist then climate change is simply a challenge for The Machine to overcome, like water scarcity or the Malthusian trap. If you're a left-leaning socialist or communist, then climate change represents a demon summoned by capitalist excess that can only be contained by changing (see: reducing) patterns of consumption. If you're an ecologist or paleontologist, then it represents the sixth mass extinction in the history of the planet.

Again, what does climate change imply about being human?

Wallace-Wells spends what I think are the most poignant chapters talking about the cosmic significance of climate change: Are we humans gods or are we bacteria? The evidence for godhood is piling up- we have reached the heavens, created artificial life, can see forward and backward in cosmic time, and communicate with anybody anywhere across our planet instantly. There is no reason to think that we will not continue to get better and better at manipulating the atoms around us unless we're interrupted.

Yet, there is also evidence for being nothing more than oversized bacteria, swimming in our own shit: A bacteria is not a thinking thing. It is a complex set of chemical states and those states change and flow into one another. There is no memory of its population size, there is no predictive forecasting. There is just simple stimulus- glucose- and then there is simple excrement- shit.

Humans have the memory of our population size, and we have predictive forecasting. Our stimulus might be more complex than glucose, but sex, drug, rock n' roll, and McDonalds are all ultimately just stimuli that generate more excrement. Our excrement is high volume and highly varied, but ultimately carbon is the one that matters. Carbon is the one that causes mass extinctions. If we can't reduce it, what differentiates us from bacteria aside from size and genetic energy efficiency? Bacteria have no control over their behavior; mass suffocation is hardwired into their genetic circuits. Will we suffocate ourselves?

Are we gods?
Are we bacteria?
Are we human?
Are we dancers?
