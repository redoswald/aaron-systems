[12 Rules for Life](http://12%20Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos) is a good book, and ultimately, I think that Jordan Peterson wants to be a good person. I think that he has lots of good advice about how to be a good person. He makes a strong case for how societies actually work and how humans work at a biological level.

But he also sometimes delves into political realities, and when he does he usually straw man's his opposition. It's funny that he does this, because Peterson is only famous because he publicly shamed the host that straw manned him. This is disappointing.

I worry that Peterson will retreat into his political beliefs at the expense of his psychological, philosophical and cultural findings simply because the culture wars will force him to pick a side. The alt-right already champions him, but he hasn't championed them.

This book is worth reading.
