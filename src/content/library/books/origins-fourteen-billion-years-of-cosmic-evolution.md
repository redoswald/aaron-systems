People get the cosmic calendar wrong: The universe is not old. It is not old and wise and dirty. We tell that story to wrench dogmatic minds into realizing how small they are. Neil deGrasse Tyson does this a lot because it's an important mission.

But a lot of people who read and know their science know the analogy: The Universe's life made into a cosmic year has the stars forming in January, heavy elements forming in February, the sun forming in July, the Earth in August, life in September, the Dinosaurs dying two days ago and human civilization forming a second ago.

I propose that that is backward, and then whenever you look into the [origins](https://amzn.to/2WgOIK6) of the universe the most prescient question always becomes, "Ok, what now?"

The answer comes, "Everything".

If the Universe is compared to a human life, where the Big Bang is birth and the last star to form is its death, then we can shrink 100 trillion years to 80 years. Where are we in that cosmic life?

We're four days in.
On the first day, the universe was empty.
On the second day, the milky way developed.
On the third day, our sun was a protostar and the protoearth was swinging around it.
On the 4th day, at little bit in the morning, we were born.

We still have 79 years and 361 days to go before all the stars stop forming-- and we have some time after that.

We know our origins! It is time to write the future
