I remember reading a passage from this book in high school. For the IB Exam? An AP test? I forget, but the context now thrown up around the passage makes me queasy about whatever essay I wrote after reading. Whatever I was reading when I was 17 did not in any way indicate that I was reading the author's beginning descent towards self-annihilation.

I read Darkness Visible after The Noonday Demon, and so can't help but compare them: The Noonday Demon is the textbook you read when you are trying to build a model of the depression-universe, Darkness Visible is what you read when you need to understand how you cannot understand the darkness, and you need to do it as soon as possible.
