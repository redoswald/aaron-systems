Trash tier self-help book. Imagine if you feed GPT-2 (the @dril version) the text of a thousand popular + useful self-help books and psychology books, and this is very similar to the output that you would find. TRITE AF. This triteness is just the tip of the iceberg. It follows into incoherence: "Write in a journal!" Benny-boy so helpfully advises, despite the fact it has nothing to do with environment whatsoever.

Most self-help books have coherent theories behind their advice. Ferris has "make 3rd world people do your labor" and GTD has "just make a fucking list". This book's advice? "Just do random shit until it sticks and stop hanging out with losers lmao; grit it up mister growth mindset".

Benjamin does talk about how "changing your environment" will allow you to achieve the goals you set. Maybe that's his theory? "Don't keep beer in your fridge so you won't be tempted to drink it" he might say.

What about at the grocery, store bud?

"Hey, Publix manager, could you remove the Orange Blossom Ale from the shelves so I won't be tempted to it?"

"Well, no, some people like it, you just need to use your willpower, Son."

"But Benjamin told me Willpower Doesn't Work."

"Guess you're fucked kid, but these are on sale."

"Nice, I'll take enough to get hungover."

Christ.&nbsp;
