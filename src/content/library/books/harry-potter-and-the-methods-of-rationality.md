The unfinished fan fiction is not just Harry Potter with science, it is the combination of several genres that its author/TVTrops calls "Rational Fic". The reason is that all the characters are smart. The book satires the original, but introduces a new plot filled with dastardly plans, a mysterious villian, and young Harry trying to unravel the entire new magical world in a scientific and repeatable fashion. 

It is very fun.
