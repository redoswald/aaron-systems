["A Colony in a Nation"](http://A Colony in a Nation) is warning to "a Nation"- you cannot maintain tyranny without losing freedom, you cannot own another human being and keep your soul. The bonds that grip black Americans today were put there incrementally and mindfully. They will get Americans if we tolerate them in an incrementally but mindless way.

Black lives matter, and if we deny that black lives matter then we will create a world where none do.
