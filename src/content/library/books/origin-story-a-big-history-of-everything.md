[This is a good book](http://This is a good book and I recommend it. If you’ve read Sapiens, you’ll recognize the style: when you zoom out of the trivial century-to-century history, where we think that tweets determine what’s going to happen to our civilization, then you’ll see a picture that’s more deterministic, stable and inexorable: Entropy rages against all things, from suns to sons, and all things rage back, from light to life.  Take Sagan’s cosmic calendar and expand it to a chronological book and you’ll have this book. That’s a good thing. It’s important to meditate on how you literally are the center of the universe, how you are made of starstuff, and how you represent a sampling of the most complex things in the universe.   What Sagan and other scientists often fail to mention, however, is that we have a lot of life yet to live in this universe. If you lived ten times our universe’s live- 130 billion years- then you would still have another 1000 lives to go. Everything- inflation, the formation of stars and galaxies, of life, humans, civilization... you.   EVERYTHING so far is just a prelude. This book is just a prologue worth reading.) and I recommend it.
