A collection of experiments using AI to generate and transform music.

## Experiments

### Melody Generation

Using transformer models to generate melodies in various styles.

### Style Transfer

Applying the "style" of one piece to the structure of another.

### Collaborative Composition

Tools for human-AI collaborative music creation.

## Why This Matters

Music is a fascinating domain for AI because it requires both technical precision and creative expression. These experiments explore that boundary.
