A tool I built to help maintain meaningful connections with people in my network.

## The Problem

It's easy to lose touch with people. Email and social media make it easy to stay passively connected, but real relationships require active maintenance.

## The Solution

PRM Tracker helps you:

- Set reminders for when to reach out
- Track conversation history and context
- Prioritize relationships based on your goals

## Technical Details

Built with [your stack here]. More details coming soon.
