# Welcome to the New Look of the Website

Welcome to the new look of the website.

It’s a more straightforward system now: clear, legible, and intentionally organized—built to be easier for everyone to read and navigate.

## The Old Design: A Website Shaped Like a SQL Editor

![Old UI](/images/old-ui.png)

If you remember the original version of the site (the one I introduced in my earlier “hello world”), it was designed to look and behave like the **DataGrip SQL editor**. That wasn’t an arbitrary aesthetic choice—DataGrip is the tool I spend the most time in day-to-day, and it offers a genuinely compelling interaction model:

- A strong sense of **structure and hierarchy**
- A “workspace” feel that supports moving between sections quickly
- The **ability to search** through content in a way that feels native and powerful

In other words: the website wasn’t just *styled* like an editor; it was trying to *borrow an editor’s navigation logic*.

## What Worked (and What Didn’t)

That design landed well with certain audiences:

- Programmers found it **interesting**
- People who were “computer-adjacent” described it as **compelling**, **distinctive**, and even **memorable** as a personal brand

But there was a major downside: it caused a lot of people to bounce.

### Why Non-Technical Visitors Bounced

For visitors who aren’t technical, the UI cues communicated something very different than what I intended.

To most people, a screen full of panes and tool-like windows doesn’t read as “cool interactive portfolio.” It reads as:

- “Something broke.”
- “I’m seeing internal developer stuff.”
- “Did I accidentally open an inspector panel?”

In normal web browsing, multiple panes and dense UI elements are often associated with debugging tools: developer consoles, inspectors, logs—things that are not meant for everyday readers. So even though the design was intentional, it sometimes looked like an error state.

## Back to the Drawing Board: Who Is This Website For?

So I went back to the drawing board with a simpler question:

> Who do I want to be able to use this site most?

### 1) Me

I want a place where I can:

- view what I’ve written and worked on,
- keep it organized,
- and present it in a way that feels coherent and durable.

### 2) Everyone Else

I also want other people to be able to:

- read what I’ve written without friction,
- explore what I’ve built without needing context,
- and feel a bit of *personality*—not just a list of links.

## The New Layout: Everything Front and Center

![New UI](/images/new-ui.png)

That’s what the new layout is designed to do.

The goal is to put the content **front and center**, with less fuss and fewer “UI puzzles.” It’s still *my* site, but it’s no longer asking visitors to decode a metaphor before they can read.

### Adding Lifestyle + Character

To bring in more “lifestyle character” (and frankly, just more visual warmth), the site now highlights things like:

- **project history**
- **film history**
- **book history**

These elements add a pop of color and a sense of dimensionality—proof of taste and texture, not just output.

## The Trade-Off: Sameness vs. Legibility

This is definitely a trade-off.

There’s a real tension here that people like Lindy Man (and others writing in that orbit) point to: economic and market pressures tend to push products—especially interfaces—toward a certain sameness. Toward familiar layouts. Toward patterns people already recognize. They call this [Refinement Culture](https://medium.com/@lindynewsletter/refinement-culture-51d96726c642)

And sometimes that’s frustrating.

But sometimes it’s also fine.

Because “recognizable” doesn’t have to mean “soulless.” The challenge is figuring out how to keep the site **usable** while still finding ways to break through the default template and make it feel unmistakably personal.
