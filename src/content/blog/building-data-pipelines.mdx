This is a placeholder post about data pipelines. Replace this with your actual content.

## The Challenge

Building data pipelines that are both reliable and maintainable is harder than it looks.

## Key Principles

1. **Idempotency** - Operations should be safe to retry
2. **Observability** - You can't fix what you can't see
3. **Simplicity** - The best pipeline is one you can understand at 3am

## Code Example

```python
def process_batch(records):
    """Process a batch of records idempotently."""
    for record in records:
        if not already_processed(record.id):
            transform_and_load(record)
```

More details to come in future posts.
