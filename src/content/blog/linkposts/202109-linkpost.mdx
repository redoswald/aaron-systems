*If narcissists climb the career ladder so quickly, maybe the rest of us should start practicing our self-aggrandizing elevator pitches.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Experts Versus Elites** ([overcomingbias.com](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/02/experts-versus-elites.html)) In this thoughtful piece, Robin Hanson distinguishes between experts, who possess deep specialized knowledge, and elites, selected more for prestige markers like wealth, charm, or fame. He argues that society disproportionately favors elites' opinions, even on technical matters, leading to suboptimal decisions. I would note that this dynamic reminds me of how organizational hierarchies often prioritize status over substance, much like in broader societal debates.

**How Narcissists Climb the Career Ladder Quickly** ([bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210830-how-narcissists-climb-the-career-ladder-quickly)) Research shows narcissists advance 29% faster to CEO roles due to strong self-promotion, despite no superior achievements. The study, involving \~200 Italian CEOs using the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, links this to risky behaviors like fraud and poor collaboration, as seen in Enron's collapse. Implications include organizational harm from inexperienced leaders; workplaces should counter with ethical rewards and diverse hiring. A colleague would point out how this explains some baffling promotions we've all witnessed.

## Academic Research & Science

**Inherited Genetic Factors Influencing COVID-19 Severity** ([science.org](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj3624)) This paper uncovers how a Neanderthal-derived haplotype on chromosome 12 reduces severe COVID-19 risk by 22%, through enhanced OAS gene expression degrading viral RNA. Using UK Biobank (n=2,244 critically ill; n=10,000 controls) and other cohorts (total \~17,000 cases), methods included GWAS, fine-mapping, and CRISPR validation. Key finding: the protective allele, absent in Africans but common elsewhere (23-37%), explains population severity differences. Implications suggest evolutionary insights into pandemics and potential antiviral therapies. I would highlight how this ties into broader discussions on genetic legacies shaping modern health.

**Picking Embryos With Best Health Odds Sparks New DNA Debate** ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-17/picking-embryos-with-best-health-odds-sparks-new-dna-debate)) Polygenic risk scoring for embryos, as used for the first reported child Aurea, assesses disease odds like heart conditions or cancer, potentially extending to traits like intelligence. Ethical debates center on eugenics risks and inequality. A pal would observe that while framed as disease prevention, it opens doors to designer babies, echoing sci-fi warnings.

## Technology & Society

**How Hollywood Sold Out to China** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/09/how-hollywood-sold-out-to-china/620021)) Hollywood's self-censorship for China's market—e.g., editing *Bohemian Rhapsody* for LGBTQ content, banning films with ghosts—stems from 2020's box-office dominance (China: \>75,500 screens vs. U.S.: \~41,000). Cases like Chloé Zhao's backlash and John Cena's Taiwan apology illustrate compliance, per PEN America's report. Implications: eroded creative freedom normalizes authoritarian influence globally. Someone would quip that it's trading artistic integrity for yuan, but the pandemic amplified this dependency.

**If You Never Met Your Co-Workers in Person, Did You Even Work There?** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/08/business/remote-office-co-workers-working-from-home.html)) Remote work's isolation fosters an "easy-come, easy-go" mindset, with record quits (3.9M in April 2021). Examples: employees cycling jobs without meetings, fraying connections. Implications: retention challenges, weakened culture. I would add that while convenient, it misses the serendipity of office bonds, making loyalty feel abstract.

## Politics & Current Events (2021)

**Quiz: If America Had Six Parties, Which Would You Belong To?** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/08/opinion/republicans-democrats-parties.html)) Proposing proportional multimember districts via the Fair Representation Act to enable six parties, reducing gridlock through coalitions. Arguments: boosts turnout, innovation; examples from multiparty democracies. Implications: dynamic Senate, less hyperpartisanship. A buddy would note it's a fresh fix for our polarized mess, drawing from diverse voter surveys.
