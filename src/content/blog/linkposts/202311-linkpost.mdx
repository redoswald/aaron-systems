*If machine intelligence wipes us out like bacteria on a freshly washed hand, at least we can console ourselves with a virtual flight over ancient Rome's baths before the end.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Why I Am Now a Christian** ([unherd.com](https://unherd.com/2023/11/why-i-am-now-a-christian/))  
Ayaan Hirsi Ali recounts her journey from Islam to atheism and ultimately to Christianity, arguing that atheism leaves a "God hole" filled by irrational ideologies and fails to provide the moral framework needed to defend Western values against threats like authoritarianism and Islamism. She emphasizes Christianity's role in fostering freedom, science, and human dignity, critiquing atheism's inability to answer life's purpose. I would note that this resonates with broader questions of human nature's need for unifying narratives, especially in times of civilizational strain.

**Machine Intelligence, Part 1** ([blog.samaltman.com](https://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-1))  
Sam Altman explores why superhuman machine intelligence poses an existential threat to humanity, not through malice but indifference, using analogies like humans washing away bacteria. He discusses risks from recursive self-improvement and emergent behaviors, linking to the Fermi paradox as a potential explanation for cosmic silence. I would observe that this highlights philosophy's intersection with technology, urging us to confront how human survival instincts clash with unintended AI outcomes.

**The Danger of Coalitionism** ([dilanesper.substack.com](https://dilanesper.substack.com/p/the-danger-of-coalitionism))  
Dilan Esper examines how political coalitions demanding adherence to specific rhetoric or falsehoods—such as denying climate change on the right or romanticizing violence on the left—distort discourse and hinder effective action. Using examples like David Shor's firing and gender issue debates, he argues this prioritizes language over truth, creating illusions of debate. A colleague would point out that this underscores human nature's tribal tendencies, where coalition loyalty trumps rational discussion, with broad implications for moral and political frameworks.

## Academic Research & Science

**Teacher Performance and Student Learning: Evidence from a Random Assignment Experiment** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ej/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ej/uead099/7450460?redirectedFrom=fulltext))  
This study evaluates teacher performance through a random assignment experiment, finding that substantial emphasis on improving classroom practices through teacher assignment can enhance student learning, though fiscal policy and social grants have not yielded similar results. Methodology involves analyzing data from comparator countries, with conclusions stressing the need for new strategies to boost competitiveness and job creation. I would suggest this offers timeless insights into education's role in human development, challenging assumptions about quick fixes in learning systems.

**A Group of Scientists Set Out to Study Quick Learners. Then They Discovered They Don't Exist** ([kqed.org](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62750/a-group-of-scientists-set-out-to-study-quick-learners-then-they-discovered-they-dont-exist))  
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon analyzed 27 datasets from 7,000 students using educational software, finding consistent learning rates across individuals—about 2.6 percentage points improvement per attempt for the fastest quartile versus 1.7 for the slowest—with differences attributed to prior knowledge rather than innate speed. Methodology tracked baseline accuracy and practice gains, concluding mastery requires 7-8 attempts on average. Implications challenge talent myths, emphasizing practice for all. Someone would remark that this demystifies human learning, showing persistence over "gifts" as key to growth.

## Technology & Society

**Inside Foxconn’s Struggle to Make iPhones in India** ([restofworld.org](https://restofworld.org/2023/foxconn-india-iphone-factory/))  
Foxconn's shift of iPhone production to India involves Chinese engineers training local workers amid challenges like higher defect rates, language barriers, and resistance to long shifts, with workers facing physical tolls. Methodology draws from on-site observations and interviews, revealing implications for global supply chains as Apple diversifies from China. I would highlight how this reflects technology's societal ripple effects, from labor conditions to geopolitical manufacturing moves.

**Seeing Like a Bank** ([bitsaboutmoney.com](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/seeing-like-a-bank/))  
Patrick McKenzie explains banks' bizarre behaviors, like forgetting customer details or sudden closures, as stemming from complex, legacy systems and regulatory constraints, using examples from mergers and tiered support. Reasoning adapts "Seeing Like a State" to financial institutions, implying better understanding reduces frustration. A buddy would note this illuminates technology's societal blind spots, where efficiency in ledgers masks human-scale inefficiencies.

**Pushy Checkout Screens Are Helping ‘Tipflation’** ([theverge.com](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/11/23955381/checkout-screens-tipping-pos-kiosk))  
Mia Sato details how digital tip prompts, with preset high percentages, fuel "tipflation," citing Pew data showing 72% of Americans see tipping expected more widely. Implications include consumer anxiety and shifting economic norms. I would observe that this captures technology's subtle influence on social behaviors, turning everyday transactions into moral dilemmas.

## Economics & Development

**Madison \#3** ([granolashotgun.com](https://www.granolashotgun.com/granolashotguncom/madison-iii))  
Johnny Sanphillippo describes purchasing a $245,000 duplex in Madison as an affordable housing template, noting its location perks and potential for owner-occupancy to offset costs amid rising market prices. Implications critique zoning barriers to modest builds. I would point out this as a practical framework for economic mobility in constrained markets.

**Growth Through Inclusion in South Africa** ([growthlab.hks.harvard.edu](https://growthlab.hks.harvard.edu/publications/growth-through-inclusion-south-africa))  
Ricardo Hausmann et al. diagnose South Africa's stagnation, using two-year research from nine papers to identify state collapse and spatial exclusion as barriers, concluding new strategies are needed for competitiveness and jobs. I would suggest this underscores development economics' focus on inclusive policies amid persistent inequality.

**Who Really Does the Work in Your Company?** ([inc.com](https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/who-really-does-work-in-your-company.html))  
Jim Schleckser outlines Price's law, where the square root of employees does half the work (e.g., 100 in a 10,000-person firm), advising selective hiring and rewarding top performers. Implications warn of productivity dilution in growth. A pal would emphasize this as a reminder for economic efficiency in scaling businesses.

## Climate & Environment

**Climate Change Is Pushing an Indigenous Community in Panama Off Their Island Home** ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/panama-island-locals-relocated-climate-change-photos-2023-9))  
The Guna of Carti Sugtupu, a 1,200-person community, are relocating due to 3.5mm annual sea level rises causing prolonged floods, with government-built mainland homes delayed to February 2024\. Implications position this as a model for 216 million climate migrants by 2050\. I would note the human cost of environmental shifts, blending resilience with loss.

## Reference & Curiosities
