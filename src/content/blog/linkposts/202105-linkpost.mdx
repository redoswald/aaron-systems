*Evolution's got our backs – or should I say, our behinds?*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Views Aren't About Sights** ([overcomingbias.com](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/05/views-arent-about-sights.html))  
This piece explores why people value window views or patios with scenic vistas, arguing it's not just about the visual pleasure but deeper psychological and status signals. I would note that on days when we're drawn to beaches or cities, these spaces rarely get used as much as we imagine, yet they hold appeal for signaling lifestyle aspirations.

**The Age of Kayfabe** ([freddiedeboer.substack.com](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-age-of-kayfabe))  
Freddie de Boer delves into how modern life feels like professional wrestling – scripted struggles where authenticity is performative. I would observe that this fakery permeates politics and culture, making genuine engagement feel obsolete, though it's memorable for capturing that uneasy rhythm of daily illusions.

## Academic Research & Science

**Pathogens and Human Evolution** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab147/6277411))  
This paper examines how infectious diseases have shaped human evolution, using genomic data from 26 populations (sample sizes not specified beyond diverse global groups) to identify adaptive signals in immune-related genes. Methodology involved analyzing ancient DNA and modern genomes to trace pathogen-driven selection pressures. Key findings show rapid evolution in response to plagues like the Black Death, with implications for understanding modern disease resistance – for instance, certain alleles increased in frequency post-epidemic. I would highlight a quote: "Pathogens exert selective pressure on human populations," underscoring how our ancestors' survival hinged on genetic adaptations that still influence health today.

**Achievement Gaps: Race vs. Poverty Segregation** ([brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2020/01/20/the-achievement-gap-in-education-racial-segregation-versus-segregation-by-poverty/))  
Drawing on a large dataset from Reardon et al. (2019) covering grades 3-8 in half of U.S. school districts (including 96% of Black public school students), this analysis reveals that poverty segregation, not racial segregation, drives about 10% of the Black-white achievement gap. Methodology used standardized test scores in math and English, controlling for exposure to poor or minority peers. Specific data: A one standard deviation increase in poor schoolmate exposure explains 10% of the gap, while racial effects vanish when poverty is factored in. Implications suggest integrating schools by income could reduce gaps and promote racial mixing, given their correlation.

**Inherited Occupations** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/22/upshot/the-jobs-youre-most-likely-to-inherit-from-your-mother-and-father.html))  
Based on General Social Survey data from 1994-2016, this interactive shows sons are 2.7 times likelier to follow fathers' jobs and 2 times mothers', while daughters are 1.8 times for mothers and 1.7 for fathers. Methodology aggregated responses on parental and personal occupations, revealing dynastic fields like law (sons 20 times likelier if mother is a scientist). Visualizations depict likelihood ratios for various jobs. Conclusions point to family influence via conversations and aptitudes, implying social mobility barriers where advantages (or disadvantages) are inherited.

**The Evolution of Anuses** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/evolution-butts/618915/))  
This article unpacks the evolutionary origins of anuses, blending biology with humor to explain how this feature enabled complex life forms. A colleague shared this, noting its quirky take on anatomy's role in survival, which sticks in mind for highlighting overlooked aspects of human nature.

## Technology & Society

**Addiction by Design Review** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-addiction-by-design))  
Natasha Dow Schüll's ethnographic study of Las Vegas machine gambling reveals how slots are engineered for addiction, using randomness and "near misses" to create a "zone" of escape. Key findings from interviews with gamblers (sample not quantified but in-depth) show players seek rhythm over wins, with industry tweaks like losses disguised as wins boosting play time. Implications extend to apps like TikTok, where similar designs shift blame to users. I would note a reader's comment: "The key to addiction is 'dark flow'," drawing parallels to video game compulsions.

**Highway Removals in Cities** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html))  
This interactive details how 1950s highways demolished Black neighborhoods (displacing over a million), using Rochester's Inner Loop removal as a case (cost: $18M, reconnecting areas). Current projects in 30+ cities, like Detroit's I-375, aim to restore communities. Implications for equity: Reduces pollution but risks gentrification, with Biden's $20B plan emphasizing affordable housing.

**Basecamp's Internal Turmoil** ([platformer.news](https://www.platformer.news/p/-how-basecamp-blew-up))  
Chronicling Basecamp's meltdown after banning political discussions, leading to 20+ resignations (over 1/3 of 57 staff) post a heated all-hands. Key issues: A "funny" customer names list sparked DEI debates, deemed linked to hate by some. Quotes like an employee's "White supremacy doesn't exist" remark fueled exits. Implications: Tech firms' speech limits can backfire, eroding trust.

**White Supremacy Culture Critique** ([slowboring.com](https://www.slowboring.com/p/tema-okun))  
Matthew Yglesias critiques Tema Okun's framework labeling traits like urgency and perfectionism as "white supremacy culture," adopted by places like Duke University and Yale Drama. No direct racial ties, yet it influences trainings (e.g., NYC schools). Implications: Harms progressive orgs by undermining structure, potentially crippling effectiveness.

**Startup Moms Challenges** ([femfosec.com](https://www.femfosec.com/what-nobody-says-about-startup-moms/))  
This essay discusses balancing startups and motherhood, noting kids consume time but parents often embrace it. A buddy would point out practical ties to broader life frameworks, useful for rethinking work-family dynamics.

## Economics & Development

**American Gentry Class** ([patrickwyman.substack.com](https://patrickwyman.substack.com/p/american-gentry))  
Patrick Wyman describes a hidden elite owning local assets (e.g., franchises, land) worth millions, influencing politics via Chambers of Commerce. Historical parallels to Roman elites; economic data: Wealth in tens of millions, hereditary. Implications: Drives U.S. inequality, shaping local policies against change.

## Climate & Environment

**Building Carbon Capture Startups** ([caseyhandmer.wordpress.com](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/05/04/so-you-want-to-build-a-carbon-capture-company/))  
Casey Handmer outlines CC challenges, from energy efficiency (e.g., 19.4 kJ/mol Gibbs limit) to scalability (e.g., 10 GT CO2/year needs massive resources). Advice: Verify net reduction via radiocarbon dating ($hundreds/test). Implications: Startups must navigate physics and finance for viable climate solutions.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Common Misconceptions List** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions))  
This Wikipedia page corrects widespread myths across history, science, and culture. Someone shared this, and it's handy for debunking fads that won't age well.

**Samaritanism Overview** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritanism))  
Detailing the Samaritan religion's Torah adherence and distinct practices from Judaism. I would note its curiosity as a surviving ancient faith, offering timeless insights into religious evolution.

## Politics & Current Events (2021)

**Hong Kong Banks Warning** ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-security-chief-warns-citigroup-hsbc-against-dealings-with-pro-democracy-tycoon-11622129514))  
Hong Kong's security chief cautions banks like Citigroup and HSBC against dealing with pro-democracy figures amid crackdowns. A pal would observe this signals escalating tensions, relevant for global finance shifts.

**Israel-Palestine Peace Challenges** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/opinion/israel-palestine-gaza.html))  
Bret Stephens argues rushed peace risks worse wars, citing historical failures. Implications: Highlights enduring complexities in 2021's flare-ups.
