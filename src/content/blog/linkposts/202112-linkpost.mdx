*Turns out, running mice might just be the key to a sharper mind—who knew couch potatoes needed more rodent role models?*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Against Modest Epistemology** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d/p/svoD5KLKHyAKEdwPo)) I would note that this chapter from Eliezer Yudkowsky's "Inadequate Equilibria" challenges the idea of modest epistemology, arguing that excessive humility in knowledge claims can hinder progress. It uses examples like the Bank of Japan's monetary policy failures to show how deferring too much to experts or averages can perpetuate errors, suggesting instead a Bayesian approach where one updates beliefs based on evidence rather than social consensus. The implications are broad: in a world of inadequate equilibria, bold reasoning can lead to breakthroughs, reminding me how often we settle for the status quo out of misplaced modesty.

**Hugging the X-Axis: The Power of Commitment** ([perell.com](https://perell.com/essay/hugging-the-x-axis/)) This essay by David Perell explores how our culture's obsession with novelty and optionality leads to "hugging the X-Axis"—a flat life without depth—while true growth comes from climbing the "Y-Axis" through commitment. He draws on frameworks like the Secretary Problem for balancing exploration and exploitation, with practical advice like starting small commitments to build tolerance. I would observe that this resonates with how sustained focus in relationships or work unlocks exponential rewards, much like how my own long-term projects have paid off in unexpected ways.

**The Silent Suffering of the Non-Neurotic** ([econlib.org](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/11/the_neurotic_he.html)) Bryan Caplan's post delves into neuroticism as a personality trait bundling negative emotions like sadness and anger, using Seinfeld characters—George as high-neurotic, Kramer as low—to illustrate. It argues that high-neurotics often impose their emotions on others, amplified by media and politics, burdening non-neurotics who prefer calm. I would point out that this explains why societal noise feels exhausting; perhaps we need more spaces where low-neurotics can thrive without the constant pull of others' angst.

**The Three-Body Problem: Sci-Fi on Humanity's Cosmic Place** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_\(novel\))) Liu Cixin's novel weaves Cultural Revolution trauma with an alien invasion from a chaotic three-star system, exploring themes like technological progress's dual edges, nihilism's dangers, and the need for collective action against existential threats. The plot follows astrophysicist Ye Wenjie inviting Trisolarans to Earth, leading to global preparations. I would suggest it's timeless for questioning humanity's unity in crisis, much like how real-world challenges demand we transcend individualism—fascinating how the "dark forest" hypothesis mirrors geopolitical paranoia.

## Academic Research & Science

**Exercise Plasma Boosts Memory via Clusterin** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04183-x)) This Nature study shows plasma from running mice, when infused into sedentary ones, reduces neuroinflammation and enhances memory, with clusterin (CLU) as a key factor. Methodology involved proteomic analysis (TMT-LC MS3) on n=8 mice per group, revealing CLU's role in binding brain endothelial cells and dampening inflammation in models of acute brain injury and Alzheimer's (n=8-10 per group). Key findings: runner plasma increased hippocampal cell proliferation (EdU+ cells up by \~1.5-2 fold, P\<0.05) and improved fear conditioning performance. In humans, 6 months of exercise (n=unspecified impaired patients) raised CLU levels. Implications: exercise factors like CLU could inspire therapies for cognitive decline, hinting at why I feel sharper after a good run.

**Psychedelics Shift Metaphysical Beliefs** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01209-2)) In this Scientific Reports paper, psychedelics were found to induce lasting shifts from physicalism to non-physicalist beliefs (e.g., panpsychism, dualism) in 866 ceremony attendees and a clinical trial (n=59 for psilocybin vs. escitalopram). Methodology used prospective surveys and path analysis, with NPB factor (Cronbach’s alpha=0.86) showing increases at 4 weeks (d=0.33, P=0.001) and 6 months (d=0.46, P\<0.0001), stronger in naïve users (d=0.73 at 6 months). Psilocybin group shifted from materialism (d=0.45, P=0.02), correlating with well-being improvements. Implications: these changes, mediated by emotional synchrony, suggest psychedelics reshape worldviews, potentially aiding mental health—my friend mentioned how such experiences broadened their perspective on reality.

**Many Heads Are More Utilitarian** ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721003887)) This Cognition study (n=143 across two experiments) found group discussions lead to more utilitarian moral judgments than individual ones, reducing emotional stress. Using real-life and sacrificial dilemmas, collectives were more utilitarian (Experiment 1 face-to-face, Experiment 2 online), with lower anxiety during interactions. Path analysis showed no lasting individual change, suggesting normative conformity. Implications: groups may better handle tough ethical decisions by sharing emotional load, like how brainstorming with pals makes hard choices feel less burdensome.

**Towards an Animal Model of Consciousness** ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432821005830)) Based on platform theory, this Behavioural Brain Research paper proposes rodent test batteries for consciousness, including radial arm maze (working memory) and episodic-like memory tasks. It categorizes behaviors by consciousness level, with composites controlling non-conscious factors. Implications: could unlock neurobiological insights into consciousness, aiding research on disorders—intriguing how simple tests might probe something as profound as awareness.

**UC Berkeley Alumni Outcomes Dashboards** ([uccliometric.org](https://uccliometric.org/uc-berkeley-longitudinal-dashboards/)) These dashboards track 1968-2015 UC Berkeley alumni wages, industries, and courses by gender, ethnicity, and major, using California employment data (inflation-adjusted to 2020). Key data: excludes self/federal/out-of-state jobs; categorizes into six disciplines. Implications: reveal education's economic returns, showing how majors influence long-term mobility—useful for pondering career paths.

## Technology & Society

**Rapid COVID Test Stymied by FDA** ([propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-scientist-created-a-rapid-test-just-weeks-into-the-pandemic-heres-why-you-still-cant-get-it)) Irene Bosch's E25Bio developed a 15-minute antigen test in early 2020, achieving 80% sensitivity/94% specificity, but FDA hurdles (90% sensitivity demand, clinical trials) closed the application. Implications: regulatory rigidity delayed public health tools, missing chances to curb spread—frustrating how bureaucracy can block innovation when it's needed most.

**Army’s Pan-Coronavirus Vaccine** ([defenseone.com](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/12/us-army-creates-single-vaccine-effective-against-all-covid-sars-variants/360089/)) Walter Reed's SpFN vaccine, a nanoparticle with multi-strain spikes, completed positive animal and Phase 1 human trials (n=unspecified), now testing Omicron. Implications: could end variant chases, preparing for future threats—exciting for long-term pandemic resilience.

**Lecture Video Speed and Comprehension** ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3899)) This study (n=unspecified participants) found 1.25x-2x speeds yield similar immediate comprehension to normal but poorer delayed recall at higher speeds. Implications: faster playback aids efficiency but risks retention—handy for balancing learning pace.

**We Don’t Have To Die: Mind Uploading and Cryonics** ([overcomingbias.com](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/12/we-dont-have-to-die.html)) Robin Hanson argues minds as software can upload to artificial hardware for immortality, preserved via cryonics (500 frozen, costs $28k-$80k). 5% revival chance makes it worthwhile. Implications: with scale, cryonics could be funeral-cheap, averting most deaths—provocative for rethinking aging.

## Economics & Development

**Don’t F\*ck with Big Sugar** ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/12/dont-fck-with-big-sugar.html)) The U.S. sugar quota doubles prices, backed by powerful lobbying; John Boehner's memoir recounts backlash from a quip, with calls flooding for weeks. Implications: illustrates concentrated interests dominating policy, harming consumers—my colleague shared how this protects jobs but inflates costs.

**Investors and Affordable Housing** ([granolashotgun.com](https://www.granolashotgun.com/granolashotguncom/investors-and-affordable-housing)) The author, a housekeeper, bought and renovated Madison rentals, sharing their path from shed-living to collective purchases post-2008 crash. Key: frugality, market timing, group buying. Implications: shows accessible paths to ownership amid shortages—reminds me how small commitments compound.

**How Texas Processes Its Past** ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/12/how-texas-is-processing-its-past.html)) Tyler Cowen's column argues Texas addresses historic injustice via job growth and migration (95% growth since 2010 from people of color), not symbolic acknowledgments. Implications: practical inclusion over gestures—honest way to build shared prosperity.

**How to Travel to India** ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/02/how-to-travel-to-india.html)) A reader's guide advises good hotels, avoiding street food, and embracing India itself over overrated sights. Cultural insights: best food worldwide, non-punctuality. Implications: timeless for meaningful travel—focus on the essence, like how my trips there always surprise.

## Climate & Environment

**Greenland Summit Rain: Climate Change Milestone** ([edition.cnn.com](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/19/weather/greenland-summit-rain-climate-change/index.html)) First rain at Greenland's summit signals warming, with 7 billion tons fallen. Implications: accelerates ice melt, sea-level rise—stark reminder of rapid change, as a buddy noted during our weather chats.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Pauli Murray: Trailblazer in Rights** ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_Murray)) Murray's biography: civil rights lawyer, priest, coined "Jane Crow." Key: "States' Laws on Race and Color" influenced Brown v. Board; co-founded NOW. Implications: enduring legacy in equality—timeless for intersectional activism.

**Paris Syndrome: Cultural Shock Extreme** ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome)) Disappointment from idealized Paris causing psychosis in visitors, especially Japanese. Implications: highlights expectation-reality gaps—amusing how dreams clash with grit, as someone shared post-trip.

## Politics & Current Events (2021)

**China's Crackdown on U.S. Campuses** ([propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/even-on-us-campuses-china-cracks-down-on-students-who-speak-out)) ProPublica details harassment of Chinese students abroad for dissent, via CSSAs and threats to families. Cases at Purdue, Brandeis. Implications: erodes free speech, strains relations—chilling how reach extends globally.

**Don't Look Up: Broader Existential Risks** ([motherjones.com](https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/12/if-you-think-dont-look-up-is-just-an-allegory-about-climate-change-youre-missing-something/)) The film satirizes not just climate denial but unpreparedness for risks like pandemics, AI. Implications: critiques prioritizing profits over science—relevant amid Omicron, as a pal quipped about hubris.
