*Experts fucked up on COVID testing, but at least we can all agree that naming your kid Adolf is a timeless bad idea*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**The Case for One More Child** ([plough.com](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/life/parenting/the-case-for-one-more-child)) Ross Douthat argues that our society's future would be radically different if people simply had as many kids as they desire, exploring the barriers like economic pressures and cultural shifts that prevent this. I would note that this resonates with broader questions of human fulfillment, much like how frameworks for belief formation remind us to question societal norms around family and legacy.

**The Reciprocation Problem** ([spencergreenberg.com](https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2020/12/the-reciprocation-problem/)) A mathematical take on relationships and how often people should initiate hangouts, revealing tragedies in social dynamics. I would highlight its practical applications, like using game theory to balance friendships without resentment, connecting to ideas of intentional behavior in daily life.

**Why Some People Think Pets Are Children** ([psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/head-games/201903/why-some-people-think-pets-children-and-others-dont)) A study on the rise of "interspecies families" and differing views on equating pets with kids. I would observe that this ties into human nature's need for connection, especially in modern isolation, though some reactions called it a stretch—my buddy would say it's just folks filling emotional gaps.

## Academic Research & Science

**Long-Term Trends in Intergenerational Occupational Mobility** ([pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/1/251)) This paper uses population registers and survey data from 1850 to 2015 to document trends in US native-born men's occupational mobility. Key findings show mobility peaked in the mid-20th century and has since declined, with methodology involving linking census data across generations (sample sizes over millions) and implications for inequality policies. I would point out how this challenges the American Dream narrative, suggesting structural barriers persist despite education gains.

**One Minute of Marijuana Secondhand Smoke Exposure Impairs Vascular Function** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27464788/)) Rat study (n=24) shows one minute of marijuana secondhand smoke impairs endothelial function for 90 minutes, longer than tobacco smoke. Methodology used controlled exposure chambers; implications warn of cardiovascular risks in shared spaces. I would note this as a reminder that smoke is smoke, bro, even if it's trendy now.

**Artificial Light Disrupts Circadian Rhythms** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75622-4)) Review of how electric light alters 24-hour biological rhythms evolved over eons. Key points include disrupted melatonin production leading to health issues like obesity; no specific sample but cites meta-analyses. Implications urge rethinking indoor lighting. I would connect this to personal habits, like emulating natural light to feel more alive.

**Herd Immunity Approaches to COVID-19** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02948-4)) Explains why letting the virus run its course is flawed, citing models showing high death tolls before immunity thresholds. Methodology critiques proposals like Great Barrington Declaration; implications favor vaccination over natural spread. I would say researchers were shocked at misuse of the term, highlighting ethical dilemmas in public health.

**Police Killings and Mental Health in Black Communities** ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618311309)) Analysis (n=over 100,000 respondents) finds police killings of unarmed Black Americans linked to worse mental health days in Black populations. Methodology used regression on survey data; implications for systemic racism's psychological toll. I would emphasize it's not just direct victims—whole communities suffer, though fixing policing alone won't erase deeper caste issues.

## Technology & Society

**Apple's M1 Chip Performance Explained** ([erik-engheim.medium.com](https://erik-engheim.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2)) Deep dive into why the M1 outperforms Intel chips, focusing on architecture like unified memory. I would note it's a game-changer for efficiency, running fast and cool, much like how aggregation theory explains tech giants' dominance through zero marginal costs.

**M1 Macs: Truth and Truthiness** ([daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness)) Debunks myths about M1 benchmarks, emphasizing real-world speed gains. I would add that the hype is real—it's up here while competitors lag, connecting to broader shifts in computing like cloud-based tools locking down access.

**Our Craft Is Becoming Arcane** ([news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25298888)) Discussion on how tech like cloud VSCode and locked-down OSes make engineering less accessible at home. I would observe it's pushing skills to institutions, though open-source abundance counters that somewhat—a colleague would say it's gatekeeping innovation.

**Stripe Treasury: Banking as a Service** ([stripe.com](https://stripe.com/treasury)) API for embedding financial services into platforms. I would highlight its potential to disrupt banking, like how gig economies already sidestep traditional protections, raising questions about worker rights.

**TabFS: Mount Browser Tabs as Filesystem** ([omar.website](https://omar.website/tabfs/)) Browser extension turning tabs into a filesystem. I would say it's clever for productivity hacks, though a pal would joke it's just more ways to hoard digital clutter.

## Economics & Development

**Socioeconomic Mobility in the United States** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States)) Overview of upward/downward class movement, citing stagnant trends. I would connect to data showing Black advanced-degree households lag white counterparts, underscoring systemic divides.

**Why College Tuition Is So Expensive** ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2020/08/31/a-new-study-investigates-why-college-tuition-is-so-expensive/?sh=24c0b6b917a0)) Study attributes rises to subsidies inflating demand. Implications question accreditation minima and signaling value of degrees. I would note it's irresponsible stats like Black wealth gaps that fuel debates, but fungibility misunderstandings hurt too.

**Peter Thiel on COVID Marking the 21st Century's Start** ([forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/12/03/peter-thiel-says-covid-marks-21st-centurys-true-start-spac-boom-surging-ev-stocks-are-a-sign/?sh=60604f9f59ed)) Thiel sees pandemic accelerating tech shifts like EV booms. I would say it's flipping power structures, with China vaccinating millions already—roaring 2020s ahead?

**Hollow Middle Class** ([vox.com](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22166381/hollow-middle-class-american-dream)) High costs, stagnant wages eroding stability. I would point to Jersey City costing 95% more than Jacksonville, yet teachers there earn $115k—still feels precarious.

## Climate & Environment

**Flood Factor Tool** ([floodfactor.com](https://floodfactor.com/)) Assesses property flood risks. I would note it's eye-opening for planning, especially with rising seas—bet on climate bets over inflation worries.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Fort Mose Historic State Park** ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Mose_Historic_State_Park)) First free Black settlement in US. I would plan a visit—sad colonialism story, but substantive history.

**Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope)) China's giant radio telescope. I would contrast with Arecibo's collapse—hard not to think civilizational shifts.

## Politics & Current Events (2020)

**CDC's Botched COVID Testing** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/cdc-covid/2020/12/25/c2b418ae-4206-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html)) Investigation into early failures delaying US response. I would say experts fucked up, easier to see racism than caste, but context shows bungled quotes like Messonnier's on sharing tests.

**Ancient Caribbean DNA Reveals Population Shifts** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/science/dna-caribbean-islands.html)) Study finds modern residents carry more Taino genes than thought. I would note only a few thousand Taino originally, but now millions in Caribbean—crazy concepts, a friend would call the headline rad.

**Buy vs. Rent Calculator** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html)) Tool for housing decisions. I would observe many misunderstand fungibility, seeing homes as prizes not assets—bet this NIMBY blocks new builds too.

**Economic Divide in Black Households** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/04/economic-divide-black-households/)) Indicators of deepening inequality. I would call the stat on Black advanced-degree wealth irresponsible—definitely not new, but highlights low median incomes barring homeownership.

**China's New Climate Pledges** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/climate/china-xi-greenhouse-gases.html)) Xi vows emissions cuts. I would say turn anarcho-communists into authoro-ones—Poland and Hungary could wreck EU deals, no?

**2020 Bankruptcies in Retail and Restaurants** ([cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/12/business/retailers-restaurants-bankrupt-2020/index.html)) Pandemic hits hard. I would tie to jingoism distaste—ideologism spices the 21st century.

**Huawei's Uighur Surveillance** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/12/huawei-uighurs-identify/)) Tech aids oppression. A pal would call it disgusting—America loves China money, but we need to wake up.

**China's Nationalist Mood Post-COVID** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/world/asia/china-nationalists-covid.html)) Public sees power flip. I would predict COVID marks international shift—Chinese vaccinated a million with 86% efficacy while we celebrate first doses.

**Excess Deaths from Non-COVID Causes** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/13/us/deaths-covid-other-causes.html)) 100,000 more from diabetes, etc. Sent while shitting—lol, that is sad.

**Ethiopia's Manufacturing Setback** ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-manufacturing-insig-idUKKBN28J0EI)) Conflict stalls growth. I would lament—Ethiopia was hopeful, non-oil, no-apartheid economy with 100 million people.

**Amazon Halo Band Review** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/amazon-halo-band-review/)) Body scans and tone monitoring. The future you wanted—get dem Bezos bucks.
