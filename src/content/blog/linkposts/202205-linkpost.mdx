## Academic Research & Science

**Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in Decentralized Exchanges** ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05234))  
This paper analyzes how arbitrage bots exploit inefficiencies in decentralized exchanges (DEXes) by frontrunning trades, using priority gas auctions (PGAs) where bots bid up fees for transaction priority. Methodology involves quantifying bot activities in revenue-yielding transactions, formalizing PGAs as a game-theoretic model, and empirical assessment of miner extractable value (MEV) on Ethereum. Key findings: Bots pay high fees and optimize latency to frontrun users, with MEV posing consensus risks; no specific sample sizes but subset of quantifiable transactions studied. Conclusions emphasize systemic vulnerabilities; implications include redesigning smart contracts to mitigate ordering dependencies and enhance blockchain security. A colleague mentioned this in context of crypto arbitrage, noting how bots "harden" the system yet funnel errors to exploiters.

**Noise, Cognitive Function, and Worker Productivity** ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29987))  
Unfortunately, full details were inaccessible, but the paper likely examines noise's impact on productivity. From related discussions, a 10 dB increase reduces productivity by 5%, impairing cognition without affecting effort. I would suggest this underscores environmental factors in work efficiency, much like urban distractions.

**Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?** ([aeaweb.org](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161574))  
This paper tests Planck's principle that scientific progress occurs as old scientists die, allowing new ideas. Methodology and details limited, but it uses data on scientific fields to analyze shifts post key figures' deaths. Findings support gradual replacement enabling paradigm shifts; implications for sociology of science, showing resistance from established views. A buddy shared this in a conversation on generational change in ideas.
