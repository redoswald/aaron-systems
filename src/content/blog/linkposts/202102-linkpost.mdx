*Who knew that extremists struggle with complex tasks? Maybe they should try a puzzle before plotting world domination.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

\**P(A|B) \= \[P(A)P(B|A)\]/P(B), All The Rest Is Commentary* ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions-34)) This piece applies Bayesian reasoning to psychiatric conditions, showing how probabilities and evidence interplay in understanding mental health. I would note that it's a clever framework for demystifying why some disorders seem linked yet distinct, with practical ties to diagnosis and treatment.

**Book Review: The Cult Of Smart** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart)) DeBoer's book critiques education's role in perpetuating inequality through innate intelligence differences, largely genetic per behavioral studies. Key proposals include lowering the dropout age to 12 to free non-benefiting students and abolishing charters for fraud. Implications challenge meritocracy, advocating equality of results over opportunity, serving managerial class interests.

**In Defense Of Myers-Briggs** ([dynomight.net](https://dynomight.net/in-defense-of-myers-briggs.html)) Defending MBTI against critics, it correlates strongly with Big Five traits (e.g., E-I with extraversion) and offers better social discussability with neutral axes. Cronbach’s alpha shows comparable reliability (.80-.87 for MBTI vs. .74-.92 for Big Five). Implications: MBTI's accessibility aids personality talks without Big Five's discomfort.

## Academic Research & Science

**People With Extremist Views Less Able To Do Complex Mental Tasks, Research Suggests** ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/feb/22/people-with-extremist-views-less-able-to-do-complex-mental-tasks-research-suggests)) Cambridge study with 330+ US participants used 37 neutral neuropsychological tasks (e.g., memorizing shapes) and modeling. Findings: Extremists think in black-and-white, struggle with complexity, show impulsivity, and poor evidence processing. Conservatives cautious, liberals imprecise. Explains 30-40% ideological variance vs. 8% demographics. Implications: Aids radicalization prevention via cognitive assessments.

**The Body Is Far From Helpless Against Coronavirus Variants** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/antibody-evolution/618004/)) Immune evolution via B/T cells adapts to variants; B cells mutate in lymph nodes, improving antibodies months post-infection. Method: Nature study tracked survivors. Findings: Vaccines reduce efficacy mildly (e.g., J\&J 72% to 57% vs. variants), but protection persists via cross-reactivity. Implications: Vaccines dim risk, not eliminate; rapid rollout curbs mutations.

**‘A Game Changer’: Drug Brings Weight Loss In Patients With Obesity** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/health/obesity-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide.html)) Novo Nordisk-sponsored trial at 129 centers, 2,000 participants, 68 weeks of weekly semaglutide injections vs. placebo. Findings: 15% average weight loss (vs. 2.4% placebo), \>33% lost 20%+. Improved diabetes symptoms, marginal GI side effects. Conclusions: New era for obesity treatment. Implications: Reduces obesity consequences like diabetes.

**When Could The United States Reach Herd Immunity? It’s Complicated** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html)) PHICOR model uses historical data, transmissibility, distancing, 90% vaccine efficacy, 80% vaccination rate. Threshold 70-90%. Baseline: July 2021\. Scenarios: 3M shots/day by May (90K deaths); end restrictions April (170K deaths, June threshold); variants (200K deaths, July). Implications: Vaccines reduce severe illness; variants may require boosters.

## Technology & Society

**WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-of-legible)) Legible expertise (e.g., WebMD, Fauci) optimizes for power/legal safety over accuracy, listing unprioritized side effects (warfarin: 40K ER visits/year vs. aspirin's safety). Examples: FDA's unrelated events (lightning strikes). Implications: Dilutes info; illegible experts (e.g., bloggers) more accurate but unscalable.

**Book Review: Fussell On Class** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class)) Fussell's framework: Upper (natural materials, low profile), middle (status anxiety, education), proles (mass culture). Indicators: Flowers (rhododendrons upper-middle), dining times. "Class X" transcends signaling. Applications: Spot class via choices; "prole drift" shifts signals. Connections: Modern shifts to politics/education over aesthetics.

## Economics & Development

**How Britain Decarbonised Faster Than Any Other Rich Country** ([economist.com](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/15/how-britain-decarbonised-faster-than-any-other-rich-country)) Britain phased out coal for electricity; no coal burned summer 2020 (first since 1882), four plants closing by \~2023. Methodology: Shift from coal plants. Data: Two-month coal-free period. Implications: Cleaner energy transition, but harder challenges ahead for full decarbonization.

## Climate & Environment

**The Terrifying Warning Lurking In The Earth’s Ancient Rock Record** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/03/extreme-climate-change-history/617793/)) Paleoclimatology via fossils/cores: CO2 drives change; current 410ppm \>3M years. Pliocene (400ppm): 3-4°C warmer, seas 80ft higher. Eocene (600-1400ppm): 13°C warmer, acidification. Models: Clouds/vapor amplify. Implications: Models underestimate; rapid emissions risk extinctions, millennia-long warming.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Brandolini's Law** ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law)) This adage states the effort to refute bullshit exceeds producing it. A colleague would note its relevance to discourse, where debunking requires more rigor, aiding understanding of misinformation's spread and the value of critical thinking.
