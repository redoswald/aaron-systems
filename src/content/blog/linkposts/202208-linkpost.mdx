## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Hero Licensing** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dhj9dhiwhq3DX6W8z/hero-licensing))  
I would note that this concept explores how people often resist improvements unless they fit a heroic narrative, drawing on cognitive biases that prioritize status over practical progress. A colleague mentioned it's like how we dismiss incremental changes in favor of grand gestures, which ties into broader human tendencies to seek admiration rather than effectiveness.

**On Christianity** ([medium.com](https://medium.com/incerto/on-christianity-b7fecde866ec))  
Taleb's essay delves into how Christianity inverted ancient values, glorifying the weak and introducing concepts like "skin in the game" through divine suffering. I would observe that this shift has profound implications for modern ethics, as someone pointed out, influencing even secular ideologies despite their attempts to escape religious roots.

**Rules for Weird Ideas** ([dynomight.net](https://dynomight.net/weird-ideas/))  
This piece discusses why unconventional ideas are often dismissed and proposes rules for engaging with them thoughtfully. A pal shared it, noting how it encourages realism about reception and selective investigation, which connects to human biases like confirmation and the social process of truth-finding.

**Self-Improvement is Generally a Lie** ([sashachapin.substack.com](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/self-improvement-is-generally-a-lie))  
The author argues that much self-help is illusory, emphasizing acceptance over constant striving. I would suggest this resonates with observations on how pursuits of perfection often mask deeper issues, as a friend remarked on its reminder to embrace one's current state.

**Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail** ([johnsalvatier.org](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail))  
This post highlights how everyday tasks reveal hidden complexities, urging attention to overlooked details. Someone noted it's a lesson in humility, showing how missing nuances can stall progress in any endeavor.

## Academic Research & Science

**Distinguishing Features of Long COVID Identified Through Immune Profiling** ([medrxiv.org](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278592v1))  
This cross-sectional study of 215 individuals used immune phenotyping and machine learning to identify markers of Long COVID, finding differences in myeloid and lymphocyte populations, elevated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and EBV, and uniformly lower cortisol levels, with cortisol as the top predictor. Methodology involved multi-dimensional analysis; implications suggest pathways for biomarkers and further pathobiology research. A colleague would highlight how this underscores the immune system's role in persistent symptoms.

**Head Injuries and Bicycle Helmet Laws** ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0001457596000164))  
Analyzing Australian helmet laws, the study found increased helmet use but greater reductions in cycling, with only modest head injury declines possibly due to other safety measures. Key finding: helmet laws may net health losses by discouraging cycling, whose benefits outweigh risks 20:1; suggests vehicle occupant helmets could save more lives. Methodology used pre/post-law surveys; implications question mandatory helmets' efficacy.

**Link Between Parental Age and Autism, Explained** ([spectrumnews.org](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/link-parental-age-autism-explained/))  
Multiple studies show older fathers increase autism risk (e.g., sixfold for 40s vs. under 30), due to sperm mutations, with de novo mutations explaining \~20% of risk. Maternal links are less clear, with some suggesting higher risk for young mothers. Implications: later parenthood explains only 1-5% of autism rise, but aids biological insights.

**What I Learned Gathering Thousands of Nootropic Ratings** ([troof.blog](https://troof.blog/posts/nootropics/))  
Analyzing 36,163 ratings from 2,802 people using Bayesian models, key findings: lifestyle factors like sleep and weightlifting outrank many nootropics; peptides like Cerebrolysin show high life-changing probabilities; stimulants excel for focus. Methodology adjusted for biases; implications stress controlled studies over self-reports.
