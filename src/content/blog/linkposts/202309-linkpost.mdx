## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Who Goes Nazi?** ([harpers.org](https://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/))  
This timeless essay from 1941 by Dorothy Thompson explores personality types susceptible to fascism through a parlor game at a gathering, drawing from her experiences as a foreign correspondent. I would note that it's a macabre but insightful look at human nature, identifying traits like resentment, insecurity, and a craving for power in those who might align with authoritarianism. It's memorable for its psychological depth and relevance to understanding societal vulnerabilities.

**Marriage Matters More Than Career for Happiness** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/opinion/marriage-happiness-career.html))  
David Brooks argues that marriage is a stronger predictor of happiness than career success, backed by studies showing married people are 30 points happier than unmarried ones, with marital quality as the top factor in life satisfaction. A University of Chicago study and Pew surveys highlight shifting priorities among young adults, with only 32% viewing marriage as crucial. I would observe that this framework connects to broader ideas about human fulfillment, suggesting we prioritize relationships over professional achievements for lasting joy.

Anecdotes illustrate emotional strains, like feeling excluded or overwhelmed. A buddy shared this, noting how it captures the human tension between life stages, but with hope that open communication can rebuild bonds – it's useful for navigating these inevitable shifts.

Methodology mixes quantitative tracking and testimonies. Implications challenge long sentences, suggesting policy reforms for reintegration – it's eye-opening on human capacity for change.
