*Who knew goats could crash a college campus better than a frat party? No, it's not Tebow making a comeback.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Against Automaticity: Why Priming and Placebos Might Not Be Real** ([carcinisation.com](https://carcinisation.com/2023/08/22/against-automaticity/))  
This essay dismantles the idea of automatic psychological effects like priming, ego depletion, and placebo, arguing they're often replication failures or better explained by rational behavior. Key critiques include debunked studies on ego depletion (e.g., ManyLabs replications showing no effect) and placebo meta-analyses revealing small, clinically irrelevant impacts (e.g., pain reduction of 0.51 units on a 0-10 scale, depression effect size of 0.15). Implications suggest psychology should shift from unconscious automaton models to phenomenological approaches post-quantum mechanics. I would note that this challenges a lot of pop psych, like how ads supposedly work through subconscious tricks – turns out people are more rational than we think.

**The Maxim of n Guilty Men: Balancing Justice Across Cultures** ([www2.law.ucla.edu](https://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm))  
Alexander Volokh's essay traces the principle "better that n guilty go free than one innocent suffer," exploring varying n values from religious texts (e.g., Maimonides' n=1000 for executions) to legal traditions (Blackstone's n=10). It debates implications like Bentham's warning that high n leads to impunity, and U.S. cases like In re Winship (n=1). No specific methodology or sample sizes, but argues for contextual justice systems. A colleague would highlight how this shows cultural differences, like the Chinese professor's quip: "Better for whom?" when hearing the British n=99.

**Inshallah: The Cultural Depth of "God Willing"** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshallah))  
This entry explains Inshallah as an Arabic phrase meaning "if God wills," used by Muslims and others for future events, reflecting divine supremacy per the Quran. Usage varies from sincere hope to sarcastic deflection, influencing languages like Spanish (ojalá) and serving as a cultural bridge in regions with Ottoman history. I would observe it's a reminder of humility in planning, kinda like how we casually say "hopefully" but with deeper roots in fate and commitment avoidance.

## Academic Research & Science

**New Fossil Ape Challenges African Origins of Humans** ([phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2023-08-ancient-ape-trkiye-story-human.html))  
A study in Communications Biology details Anadoluvius turkae, an 8.7-million-year-old fossil cranium from Türkiye, with facial and brain case preserved. Methodology involved analyzing anatomy and ecology, finding it part of early hominines (African apes/humans ancestors). Key data: size 50-60 kg, dry forest habitat, diet of tough roots; lived with African-like fauna (giraffes, rhinos). Implications: hominines evolved in Europe 5+ million years before migrating to Africa \~9-7 million years ago due to environmental changes. A buddy would point out this flips the script on human evolution – maybe our roots are more Mediterranean than we thought.

**FDA Approves Zurzuvae: First Oral Postpartum Depression Drug** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/08/04/fda-approves-postpartum-depression-drug-zurzuvae/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNjkxMTIxNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyNTAzOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE2OTExMjE2MDAsImp0aSI6ImRiMTQ1ZGUzLTIxZjktNDRlZC1hMGM0LTk3YTMyMmY5MTdkYSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyMy8wOC8wNC9mZGEtYXBwcm92ZXMtcG9zdHBhcnR1bS1kZXByZXNzaW9uLWRydWctenVyenV2YWUvIn0.mXB0v8SEcrq2RdOfw8gnvhkvAfydQHaRmY3M3ySx5_g))  
The FDA approved Zurzuvae as the first pill for postpartum depression, a breakthrough for treating this condition affecting many new mothers. While methodology details are sparse, it's based on clinical efficacy. Implications include better accessibility over injections, potentially reducing severe cases. Specifics: first oral option, approved Friday. Someone would say this is huge for hormone-driven issues post-birth, like how Katie mentioned the crazy hormone drop and limited preventive measures.

**My Battle with Postpartum Psychosis** ([cosmopolitan.com](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a43340622/postpartum-psychosis-personal-essay/))  
Ayana Lage's essay recounts her PPP after 2020 birth: delusions (e.g., being a prophet, hearing God), paranoia, and suicidal threats leading to 17-day hospitalization with Haldol treatment. Affects 1-2 per 1,000 birthing parents; symptoms include hallucinations, harm thoughts. Implications: treatable with recovery, but highlights care gaps, referencing cases like Andrea Yates. "I felt like I was chosen," she quotes. A pal would reflect on how this shows the hormone crash's severity, tying into discussions on new mom support.

**Skyrim Civil War Survey: Political Leanings in Gaming Choices** ([cosgrrrl.com](https://cosgrrrl.com/skyrim-civil-war-survey-results-imperials-v-stormcloaks-c5bcd693f047))  
A 374-participant survey found liberals/centrists favor Imperials (1.82x more than conservatives), conservatives/libertarians lean Stormcloaks (2.29x more than liberals). Methodology: Google form on side choice, alignment. Data: conservatives 55.4% extreme positions; motivations like anti-racism for liberal Imperials, anti-imperialism for libertarian Stormcloaks. Implications: fictional choices mirror real politics, with sampling bias noted. I would note it's fascinating how even in games, views on empire and nationalism split along ideological lines.

## Technology & Society

**Why We Should Stop Testing AI Like Humans** ([technologyreview.com](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/30/1078670/large-language-models-arent-people-lets-stop-testing-them-like-they-were/))  
This piece argues LLMs' high test scores (e.g., GPT-4's bar exam pass) fuel hype but are flawed measures, as models may memorize or use stats, not understand (e.g., failing modified stacking tasks). Implications: redefine AI intelligence, use animal cognition methods for evaluation; replication issues like theory of mind tests. A friend would add that this avoids anthropomorphizing, especially with brittle performance on tweaks.

**Code Llama Fine-Tuning Beats GPT-4 on HumanEval** ([phind.com](https://www.phind.com/blog/code-llama-beats-gpt4))  
Phind's fine-tuned CodeLlama-34B-v2 scores 73.8% pass@1 on HumanEval, vs. GPT-4's 67%. Methodology: trained on \~80k problems, 2 epochs, DeepSpeed ZeRO 3, decontamination. Implications: advances open-source AI coding, verifiable on Huggingface. A colleague would observe this shows specialized datasets push models beyond closed ones like GPT-4.

## Economics & Development

**Nassau Counties: Housing Costs Drive Economic Outcomes** ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-08-15/nassau-county-in-new-york-and-florida-show-importance-of-housing-costs?cmpid=BBD081523_businessweek&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230815&utm_campaign=businessweek&sref=PnCidRcT#xj4y7vzkg))  
Compares Long Island's Nassau (high costs, exodus) to Florida's booming Northeast. Data: NY youth leave due to $10k+ camp costs vs. $6k Zurich Airbnb; employers face shortages. Implications: affordable housing boosts labor, tax base; opposition stalls solutions. Someone would say Florida's getting it right on housing policy, unlike high-income metros.

**Summer in Europe Cheaper Than US Day Camp** ([insider.com](https://www.insider.com/american-moving-to-europe-cheaper-than-us-summer-camp-2023-7))  
A family's Zurich Airbnb ($6k/2 months) undercut NY camp ($10k/child), enabling cultural trips. Implications: remote work enables cost-effective family experiences abroad. A buddy would note it's wild how US costs push families to rethink summers entirely.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Switched at Birth: Identity Crisis at 67** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/world/canada/canada-men-switched-at-birth.html))  
Two Canadians, Richard Beauvais (Métis-raised, actually Ukrainian-Jewish-Polish) and Eddie Ambrose (Ukrainian-raised, actually Métis), discovered the switch via DNA. Implications: questions racial heritage's role in identity, shaped by Canada's Indigenous policies. I would remark on how this echoes nature vs. nurture debates in real life.

**Martín Cortés: The First Mestizo's Life** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martín_Cortés_(son_of_Malinche)))  
Biography of Hernán Cortés and La Malinche's son (c.1522-1595), legitimized by Pope, knighted, but exiled after plot accusations. Context: colonial New Spain tensions. I would point out his story highlights mestizo challenges in Spanish hierarchies.

**Battle of Berezina: Napoleon's Narrow Escape** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berezina))  
1812 battle: French (36k effectives, 40k stragglers) vs. Russians (61-64k); French losses 50-60k, Russians 10k+. Outcomes: Napoleon escaped with 40k, rebuilt army. Importance: rallied Europe against him. A pal would connect it to Ridley Scott's Napoleon film, maybe that icy scene.

**Jacksonville, Georgia: From County Seat to Fishing Record** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Georgia))  
History: original Telfair seat (1814), named for Andrew Jackson; seat moved 1871\. Demographics: 111 (2020), down 20.7%. Significance: 1932 world record bass. I would note it's a quirky small-town tale, tied to local pride.

## Politics & Current Events (2023)

**Top Democrats Ranked: Progressive vs. Traditional Foreign Policy** ([washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/25/top-10-democrats-president-rankings-biden/))  
Ranks top Democrats (e.g., Biden \#1) on progressive credentials, noting foreign policy splits (Biden traditionalist, Warren progressive). Implications: party unity on alliances but debates on ideas. I would say they all seem better than moderate Republicans on key issues.

**How to Be a Supportive Auntie or Uncle** ([npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/11/1186984003/how-to-be-a-supportive-adult-in-a-kids-life))  
Tips: define role, routine contact, non-judgmental support, boundaries, discipline talks. Backed by psychologist Erlanger Turner: aids development via diverse perspectives. Implications: non-parents enrich kids' lives. A friend would share how this resonates with being an auntie figure.

**Texas Cites Noah's Ark in Border Buoy Lawsuit** ([slate.com](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/texas-republicans-noahs-ark-mexico-border-lawsuit.html))  
Texas defends Rio Grande buoys (with saws) against DOJ suit, claiming non-navigability (citing Genesis) and "invasion" allowing war powers. Implications: could enable state military actions, suspending rights. A pal would call it wild NIMBYism on borders.

**California Funds "Invent Your Own Gender" Education** ([openthebooks.substack.com](https://openthebooks.substack.com/p/invent-your-own-gender-governor-gavin))  
Newsom's admin grants $2.34M to Gender Spectrum for K-12 programs teaching limitless genders (e.g., foxgender). Data: $355k in 2022; supports secret transitions. Implications: lawsuit against disclosure policies. Someone would note the push for inclusive schools, but question parent exclusion.

**Christie Edges DeSantis in NH Poll** ([thehill.com](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4152546-christie-pulls-ahead-of-desantis-in-new-hampshire-gop-primary-poll/))  
Emerson poll: Christie 9%, DeSantis 8%, Trump 49%. Implications: DeSantis decline signals 2024 shifts. A colleague would be giddy about DeSantis slipping.

**Goats Roam UF Campus: Not Tebow or Spurrier** ([gainesville.com](https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/local/2023/08/16/goats-found-strolling-on-uf-campus-no-its-not-tebow-or-spurrier/70601919007/))  
Two goats wandered UF for weeks, eating plants, captured with watermelon; to be rehomed. Fun story with social media buzz. A friend would joke about gene-testing them for ownership.
