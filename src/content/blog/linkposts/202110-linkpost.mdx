*Who knew fruit flies had such intricate brains? If only mapping human thoughts was as straightforward as connecting 548,000 synapses.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**The WEIRDest People: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/10/joseph-henrich-weird-people/615496/))  
Joseph Henrich's theory ties Western success to the Catholic Church's family policies that broke down kin networks, fostering individualism and innovation. Key findings show each century of Church exposure reduces cousin marriage by nearly 60 percent, and a millennium makes someone 30 percentile points less likely to lie in court for a friend. Using the Kinship Intensity Index on data from anthropology and psychology, with 96% of psych subjects from WEIRD regions, it implies cultural evolution shaped cognitive styles—Westerners think analytically, others holistically. I would note this challenges assumptions about universal human nature, suggesting our peculiar psychology drove progress.

**Wireheading: Hacking the Brain's Pleasure Centers** ([vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ezzvem/wireheading-1950s-wetware-hacking))  
Dr. Robert Heath's 1950s experiments implanted electrodes to stimulate brain pleasure centers, calming psychotics and even inducing prolonged orgasms, but also causing severe pain reactions. Methodology involved surgical implants in a handful of patients, leading to a 1976 pacemaker that cured violent outbursts in a young man, seizures in a librarian, and hallucinations in a physicist—though relapses occurred with malfunctions. Implications warn of ethical risks in deep brain stimulation, now FDA-approved for Parkinson's but linked to compulsions. I would observe it's a stark reminder of how tampering with our wiring can blur lines between relief and control.

## Academic Research & Science

**Sex Differences in Adolescents' Occupational Aspirations** ([psyarxiv.com](https://psyarxiv.com/zhvre/))  
This preprint examined 473,260 adolescents' career aspirations, finding boys more likely to choose things-oriented jobs like mechanic, while girls favored people-oriented roles like nurse. Methodology used large-scale surveys across countries, revealing persistent gaps even in egalitarian societies. Key data: Boys showed higher STEM aspirations (e.g., mathematician), with implications for gender parity in workforce. Conclusions suggest biological and cultural factors interplay. I would point out this underscores why closing occupational divides remains challenging.

**Childhood IQ and Longevity: A 65-Year Follow-Up** ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC30556/))  
In a cohort of 2,792 children tested in 1932, higher IQ at age 11 predicted survival to age 76, with a 15-point disadvantage reducing survival odds to 0.79. Methodology: Longitudinal tracking via public records, using Cox regression on IQ scores (mean 100, SD 15). Sample: 2,230 traced, 1,084 deceased. Implications: IQ links to health behaviors and genetics, suggesting early cognitive factors influence lifespan. I would note wartime deaths skewed results for high-IQ men, adding nuance.

**Mapping the Fruit Fly Brain Connectome** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/science/drosophila-fly-brain-connectome.html))  
An analysis mapped 548,000 synapses in a fruit fly brain, a milestone in connectomics. Methodology: Electron microscopy on one fly brain, with AI assistance. Implications: Advances understanding of neural wiring, potentially informing AI and brain disorders. I would highlight how this tiny brain's complexity rivals larger ones.

**Parthenogenesis in California Condors** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/california-condors-are-capable-virgin-birth/620517/))  
Two condors hatched via virgin birth, with DNA from mothers only, in a program sampling over 900 birds. Methodology: Genetic testing revealed parthenotes SB260 and SB517, both males with health issues. Sample: 900+ condors. Implications: Suggests asexual reproduction may aid endangered species, though offspring were frail. I would remark it's a rare glimpse into evolutionary backups.

**Covid-19 Risks for Pregnant Women** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/world/pregnant-women-covid-vaccine.html))  
Unvaccinated pregnant women comprise 20% of England's critically ill Covid patients on ECMO. Methodology: N.H.S. data from over 100,000 vaccinations showed no fetal harm. Sample: 90,000 U.S. pregnant women vaccinated safely. Implications: Vaccines protect without risks, urging uptake. I would stress the stark reminder of infection dangers.

**Immigrant Health Advantage Among African-Origin Blacks** ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-021-09647-6))  
African-origin black immigrants (n=2,748) had lower odds of obesity, hypertension, diabetes than U.S.-born blacks (n=71,320). Methodology: Logistic regressions on 570,675 adults from 2000-2018 NHIS. Implications: Health persists despite discrimination, informing disparities research. I would observe similarities to white immigrants challenge assimilation theories.

**Maya Burial Temple in Belize** ([smithsonianmag.com](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/rare-maya-burial-temple-discovered-belize-180960054/))  
Excavations revealed a large chamber with a noble's remains and hieroglyphs on dynasty conflicts. Methodology: Dig at Xunantunich uncovered artifacts like jade, obsidian. Implications: Fills historical gaps on Maya rivalries. I would note the chamber's size hints at elite status.

## Technology & Society

David Shor's model forecasts Senate losses for Democrats due to education polarization. Key arguments: Focus on popular policies over divisive ones. Implications: Party must adapt to retain power. I would note it's a wake-up on voter shifts.

**Evaluating VPN Trustworthiness** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/technology/personaltech/are-vpns-worth-it.html))  
Many VPNs are untrustworthy post-acquisitions by dubious firms. Recommendations: Avoid paid services for most; web security suffices. Implications: Privacy tools may compromise data. I would caution on vetting providers.

## Climate & Environment

**Effective Climate Donations** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/how-to-donate-to-fight-climate-change-effectively/617248/))  
Giving Green recommends Climeworks ($1,000/ton CO2), Tradewater ($15/ton), BURN ($10/ton) for offsets; Clean Air Task Force, Sunrise for policy. Implications: Policy yields bigger impact. I would favor advocacy for scale.

**Carbon Offset Guide** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-carbon-offsets.html))
