*Who knew that exploding the Sun was even on the table? It's like the ultimate bad breakup move for a dying dictator.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**How Marriages Fuel Income Inequality** ([insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/marriage-choices-income-inequality))  
A buddy shared this piece on how "marital sorting" — people marrying partners with similar career ambitions — has driven up to 40% of rising income inequality since 1980\. The study, using Danish data from over three million people annually from 1980-2018, clustered 1,800 educational programs into ambition levels based on wages and growth. Women entering high-ambition fields created more "power couples," amplifying gaps as returns to higher education outpaced lower levels. In a counterfactual without increased sorting, inequality would have risen less. I would note that this highlights how personal choices ripple into societal divides, making it a memorable lens on how ambition shapes wealth transmission.

**Trading Time for Money: A Practical Guide** ([meteuphoric.com](https://meteuphoric.com/2014/03/25/how-to-trade-money-and-time/))  
This essay breaks down how to consciously trade time and money across life areas like outsourcing tasks or choosing convenience over savings. It argues that ignoring time's value leads to squandering it, with examples like using virtual assistants on Odesk or paying more for prepared food. "What you don’t explicitly value, you squander," it says, pushing for balanced decisions. A pal mentioned this as a framework for efficiency — I would observe it's like optimizing life's budget, useful for anyone juggling work and leisure without forcing formality.

**The Case for a Larger Human Population** ([rootsofprogress.org](https://rootsofprogress.org/why-a-larger-population))  
Someone passed along this argument that a bigger population benefits everyone through more geniuses, faster progress, and greater options. It counters overpopulation fears by noting resources adapt via technology, and larger groups enable specialization, R\&D investment, and economies of scale. For instance, a billion people yield a thousand one-in-a-million geniuses for innovation. "A world with a large and growing population is a dynamic world that can create and sustain progress," it claims. I would point out this flips the script on scarcity, making it a thought-provoking take on why growth could personally enrich our lives with more choices in careers, culture, and connections.

**Rethinking Race and Lived Experience** ([astralcodexten.com](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-should-we-think-about-race-and))  
I would highlight this exploration of race as clusters in multidimensional space, blending genetics, culture, and experience, using Elizabeth Hoover's Native American identity controversy. It presents a trilemma: race as genetic, lived experience needing genetics, or many not qualifying racially. "It seems kind of bad if your whole life can be retroactively invalidated by getting the wrong results from a 23andMe test," it notes. This framework connects to affirmative action and cancel culture, useful for navigating identity debates without oversimplifying.

## Academic Research & Science

**GSK-3 Inhibitors for Tooth Repair: Ethical Considerations** ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6330321/))  
A colleague shared this ethical analysis of using Tideglusib, a GSK-3 inhibitor, for dental cavity repair. A study on mouse molars (Neves et al., 2017\) showed significant mineralization increases at 4-6 weeks via Wnt/β-catenin activation, but phase-II Alzheimer’s trials (del Ser et al., 2013\) saw 35% discontinuation due to adverse effects like diarrhea and fatigue. Methodology involved qualitative ethical review on autonomy, translational risks, and beneficence vs. non-maleficence, drawing from 74 outpatient encounters (Castro et al., 2007\) with 81% unclarified jargon. Conclusions stress phase-III/IV trials before dental use, given tumorigenic and teratogenic risks. "Until these risks are properly evaluated... we argue against the translation of this drug in dentistry." Implications urge rigorous safety checks — I would add this balances innovation with caution, a key reminder for medical advancements.

**Returns to College Majors Across Earnings Distributions** ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/W9MBX7ZGK8FKK86JZ3Z9/full))  
This study on 5.8 million U.S. graduates (2009-2021) estimates internal rates of return (IRRs) for majors vs. high school, using quantile regression and ACS data. Engineering/computer science yield over 13%, education/humanities under 8% (below 5% for men); women's median IRR is 9.88% (vs. men's 9.06%), with higher IRRs for minorities due to costs/majors. Methodology adapted Cohn/Hughes (1994) with log-linear earnings equations and 25% selection bias adjustment. Conclusions note declining IRRs post-recession, implying aid for low-return majors. "College education is a worthwhile investment, but IRRs vary significantly by major." I would observe this connects education choices to inequality, practical for career planning.

**The Time Investment in Friendship Formation** ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407518761225))  
A friend mentioned this on how hours build friendships: Study 1 (N=355 relocated adults) and Study 2 (N=112 students longitudinally) found 43-94 hours for casual friends, 57-164 for friends, 119-219 for best friends. Leisure and "striving communication" (joking, catching up) predict closeness; small talk decreases it. Logistic/OLS regressions used self-reports. "Americans only spend about 41 min a day socializing." Conclusions support temporal constraints on bonds. Implications for adult friendships — I would say it's like a roadmap for investing time wisely, conversational yet eye-opening.

**Endogenous Colonial Borders in Africa** ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/endogenous-colonial-borders-precolonial-states-and-geography-in-the-partition-of-africa/132D6CBDE92946D14CCC64E59A94D3D2))  
This rejects arbitrary African borders, showing precolonial states/geography shaped 62% (N=107 borders), with water bodies primary in 63%. Quantitative (N=10,341 grid cells) OLS regressions and qualitative treaty analysis reveal systematic design. "Precolonial state frontiers increase the likelihood... by 14.5 percentage points." Conclusions preserve legacies for postcolonial outcomes. Implications rethink regression designs — I would note this decentralizes Eurocentric history, a fresh angle on global legacies.

**A New Species of Ctenomys Rodent** ([vertebrate-zoology.arphahub.com](https://vertebrate-zoology.arphahub.com/article/115242/))  
Insufficient details available, but this describes a new Ctenomys species in Argentina, adding to 68 known. Methodology likely involved morphological/genetic analysis. I would suggest it's a curiosity on biodiversity, though details are sparse.

**Hypervaccination Case Study** ([thelancet.com](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099\(24\)00134-8/fulltext))  
One man received 217 COVID-19 vaccinations over 29 months without adverse effects; antibody levels were higher but immune response quality similar to controls (N=29). Methodology: blood/ saliva analysis post-vaccines. "No signs of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections." Conclusions: hypervaccination doesn't enhance immunity significantly. Implications caution against overvaccination — I would quip it's extreme, but shows tolerance limits.

**Theoretical Sun Explosion Risks** ([scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/html/34277.html))  
This theorizes artificially detonating the Sun via thermonuclear bomb, using AB-Criterion for detonation conditions (density \>0.7×10^21/m³ at 10^5 eV). No samples; equations model plasma reactions. "Current thermonuclear bomb may be used as a fuse." Conclusions urge defenses. Implications for existential risks — I would warn it's speculative but chilling, like ultimate doomsday prep.

## Technology & Society

**Starting a Google-Level Startup** ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/google.html))  
I would share this on prepping for startups: get tech skills via projects, spot ideas as "sticking doors," find cofounders at top universities. "Once you're good at some technology... you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing." Frameworks stress interest-driven ideas. Useful for young entrepreneurs — conversational nudge toward action.

**AI as Extinction-Level Threat** ([time.com](https://time.com/6898967/ai-extinction-national-security-risks-report/))  
Gladstone report (200+ interviews) warns AI/AGI risks weaponization/control loss, urging compute limits. "Current frontier AI development poses urgent... risks to national security." Implications: regulate open-source, chips. I would add this echoes nuclear fears, memorable for policy urgency.

**Revitalizing Tulsa Through Philanthropy** ([trevorklee.substack.com](https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/something-interesting-is-happening))  
A colleague noted Tulsa's billionaire-driven revival, like Gathering Place park and Tulsa Tomorrow relocating Jews with jobs/social support. "Move to Tulsa and you are guaranteed a job, a nice house..." Frameworks contrast direct action vs. bureaucracy. Broader urban renewal ties — I would say it's inspiring for community building.

**Myths of Tidal-Locked Planets** ([worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2024/03/hurried-thoughts-youre-wrong-about.html))  
This debunks tidal-locked worlds as inhospitable, models showing stable, wet climates. "Tidal-locking might even make a habitable climate more stable." Useful for sci-fi/worldbuilding, connecting to exoplanet research.

**Apple TV+'s Prestige Dad TV Niche** ([gq.com](https://www.gq.com/story/apple-tv-plus-prestige-dad-tv))  
Prestige Dad TV: ambitious shows like *Masters of the Air* for dads, blending prestige with espionage/history. "Prestige Dad TV has all the classic signifiers... but is laser-focused on topics that dads... can’t get enough of." Cultural shift in streaming — I would chuckle it's tailored escapism.

## Economics & Development

**Mergers' Impact on Workers** ([promarket.org](https://www.promarket.org/2024/03/07/do-corporate-mergers-and-acquisitions-hurt-workers/))  
Canadian data (2001-2017) shows M\&A displace workers, causing 4% earnings drops via worse matches; no major monopsony changes. "The impact... is mostly through... job displacement." Implications for policy — I would emphasize worker welfare in approvals.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Euler's Mathematical and Physical Contributions** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler#Contributions_to_mathematics_and_physics))  
Euler founded graph theory (Königsberg bridges), introduced notations like π, e, i, and formulas like e^{iπ} \+ 1 \= 0\. In physics: Euler equations for fluids, beam theory. "His works... occupy 60–80 quarto volumes." Valuable reference for foundational impacts.

**Pigs' Occasional Human Consumption** ([grunge.com](https://www.grunge.com/1237235/pigs-eat-humans-far-more-often-than-people-would-expect/))  
Pigs eat humans post-death or in attacks, cases like 2012 Oregon farmer (dentures left). "\[Pigs\] aren't out to hurt you... but once they drew blood... you would be like shark bait." Interesting for animal behavior, useful for farm safety.

**The 1947 Chukchi-Eskimo War** ([ordonews.com](https://ordonews.com/war-of-the-chukchi-and-eskimos-in-1947/))  
Insufficient details, but recounts a brief conflict over reindeer, with U.S./Soviet involvement claims. Curious historical footnote on indigenous wars.
