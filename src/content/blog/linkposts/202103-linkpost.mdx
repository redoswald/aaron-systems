*Who knew a forgotten medieval fruit with a name like 'open-arse' could outlast modern fads?*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Non-Grabby Legacies in Future Civilizations** ([overcomingbias.com](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/03/non-grabby-legacies.html)) This piece explores the potential long-term impacts of civilizations like ours that don't expand aggressively across the universe. I would note that if we don't become "grabby," future advanced aliens might study our remnants for insights into their own interactions, possibly preserving or reviving us from data stores we leave behind. Key arguments include sending signals or mediators to influence grabby aliens, with implications for how non-expansive societies could shape cosmic coordination despite their limited scope.

**Book Review: Fussell on Class** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-fussell-on-class)) A review of Paul Fussell's guide to America's informal class system, dividing society into uppers, middles, and proles with detailed indicators like furniture and education preferences. I would observe that while the 1980s context shows a rigid structure, modern shifts like social media have evolved signaling from appearances to politics, highlighting ongoing status anxiety and inequality.

## Academic Research & Science

**Indigenous Basque Genetics and Isolation** ([cell.com](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(21\)00349-3)) This study on Basque genetics used whole-genome sequencing of 190 individuals from Basque-speaking regions, comparing them to other Iberian and European populations. Key findings show Basques have the highest pre-Indo-European ancestry in Iberia and low admixture, with isolation dating back 2,000-3,000 years. Methodology involved PCA, ADMIXTURE analysis, and f-statistics, revealing minimal gene flow post-Iron Age. Implications suggest cultural barriers like the Basque language preserved genetic distinctiveness, offering insights into European population history.

**Mortality in Vegetarians vs Non-Vegetarians** ([academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/70/3/516s/4714974)) Pooled data from five prospective studies (sample size: \~76,000) compared death rates, finding vegetarians had lower mortality from ischemic heart disease (death rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.94) but similar overall rates. Methodology standardized for age, sex, and smoking; vegetarians showed reduced risks for certain diseases but higher for others like breast cancer. Implications: vegetarian diets may protect against heart disease, but benefits depend on duration and other factors.

**Vitamin D and COVID-19 Risk by Race** ([jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777682)) In a cohort of 4,638 individuals (49% Black, 43% White), lower vitamin D levels (\<20 ng/mL) were linked to higher COVID-19 positivity in Black individuals (IRR 2.55; 95% CI 1.26-5.15), but not White individuals. Methodology used multivariable models adjusting for demographics and comorbidities; positivity rates for Black individuals ranged from 9.72% (\<20 ng/mL) to 3.82% (≥40 ng/mL). Implications: trials on vitamin D supplementation could reduce COVID-19 risk in deficient populations, especially Black individuals.

**Cuttlefish and Delayed Gratification** ([sciencealert.com](https://www.sciencealert.com/cuttlefish-can-pass-a-cognitive-test-designed-for-children)) Six cuttlefish passed an adapted marshmallow test, waiting 50-130 seconds for preferred prey. Methodology trained them on door symbols in a tank setup; those quickest to learn waited longest, linking self-control to adaptability. Implications: challenges assumptions about intelligence evolution, as cuttlefish show advanced cognition despite solitary lifestyles.

**Melatonin for Better Sleep** ([gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin)) Meta-analyses (e.g., Brzezinski 2005, n=unspecified but comprehensive) show melatonin reduces sleep latency by \~4 minutes and increases duration by \~13 minutes. Dosages: 0.5-3mg effective, lower (0.3mg) optimal for some. Conclusions: safe, no tolerance; net benefit \~641¢/night in time saved, worth trying for insomnia.

## Technology & Society

**Excel's Enduring Legacy** ([notboring.co](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies)) Excel, launched in 1985, dominates with 80%+ market share in intensive uses like financial modeling (e.g., in banking). Its reactive interface and recent Turing-complete updates ensure persistence, inspiring unbundled tools like Salesforce. Implications: foundational for business, with network effects sustaining it.

**Debranding Trend in Logos** ([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-07/debranding-is-the-new-branding-for-burger-king-warner-bros)) Brands like Burger King and Toyota simplify logos to flat, minimalist designs for digital optimization. Examples: Intel, Warner Bros. Reasons: app icon compatibility, nostalgia. Implications: reflects shift to mobile-first branding.

## Economics & Development

**Money and Happiness Threshold Challenged** ([visualcapitalist.com](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/chart-money-can-buy-happiness-after-all/)) Study (n=33,391 U.S. adults) used real-time mood data, finding happiness rises logarithmically with income beyond $80k/year. Methodology: random prompts; well-being scores from \-0.21/-0.34 at $15k to 0.15/0.38 at $625k. Implications: no plateau, control and reduced suffering key.

**Experiences of Being Poor-ish** ([residentcontrarian.substack.com](https://residentcontrarian.substack.com/p/on-the-experience-of-being-poor-ish)) Essay details trade-offs like unsafe housing, unreliable cars, stressful jobs. Practical: buy used, self-repair. Broader: societal gaps exacerbate inequality. Memorable for anecdotes on financial vulnerability.

**Urban Housing Prices Up, Rents Down** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/why-are-housing-prices-and-rents-down/618212/)) In top cities, home prices rose (e.g., San Jose \+14%) while rents fell (-7%). Data: Zillow. Explanations: house shortage, low rates, pandemic suburban shift. Implications: highlights inequality, potential urban revival.

## Climate & Environment

**Outdated Climate Scenarios in Research** ([rogerpielkejr.substack.com](https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/the-unstoppable-momentum-of-outdated)) High-emissions scenarios like RCP8.5 are implausible (emissions peaked 2019). \>17,000 studies use them. Critiques: denial hinders updates. Implications: reset needed for policy-relevant science.

## Reference & Curiosities
