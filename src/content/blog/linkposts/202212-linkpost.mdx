*Who knew that staring into the abyss could be a core life skill? Apparently, not the 19th-century Russian peasants, who seemed more focused on surviving their own harsh realities.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Sex Differences in Disgust Sensitivity** ([journals.sagepub.com](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1754073917709940))  
This paper explores why women consistently show higher levels of disgust than men, a robust difference that influences outcomes like mate choice and psychological disorders. Using an evolutionary-functional approach, it proposes hypotheses for sexual and pathogen disgust, drawing on prior studies with diverse samples. Key findings include women's higher disgust proneness, substantial in magnitude and replicable across methods. The methodology is theoretical, synthesizing empirical data to generate testable predictions. I would note that this ties into broader discussions on human nature, reminding us how evolutionary pressures shape everyday behaviors in unexpected ways.

**Why Are Women Hot?** ([putanumonit.com](https://putanumonit.com/2022/12/13/why-are-women-hot/))  
An exploration of why women invest heavily in appearance, arguing it's not just for sex appeal but for complex social signaling in dating and status. Key points include men's revealed preferences for traits like hourglass figures, contrasted with class-based standards where upper-class women favor svelte builds. Notable examples from VIP clubs show beauty as a status symbol for men, not direct romance. I would observe that this reveals the intricate dance of attraction, where beauty often serves deeper societal roles beyond instinct.

**Wife Economics and the Domestication of Man** ([kvetch.substack.com](https://kvetch.substack.com/p/wife-economics-and-the-domestication))  
This essay delves into polygamy's historical prevalence and Christianity's role in enforcing monogamy, arguing humans are naturally polygamous yet societies are mostly monogamous today. Key points cover reproductive biology's asymmetries and women's economic roles in polygamous groups like the Lakotas, where labor drove wealth. Examples from ancient empires show elite men with multiple wives, leading to inequality. I would note that monogamy channels men's energies productively, a civilizational hack worth pondering in modern times.

**Brokenism: The Real Divide in America** ([tabletmag.com](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/brokenism-alana-newhouse))  
The piece argues today's key debate is between "status-quoists" who reform institutions and "brokenists" who see them as irreparably flawed, needing replacement. Key points include cross-spectrum alignments and Jewish thought's emphasis on engaging a broken world. Examples like homeschooling and alternative media illustrate brokenist actions. I would remark that this framework captures societal flux, urging us to notice foundational cracks without despair.

**You Can't Take It With You: Epigenetics and Intergenerational Trauma** ([razib.substack.com](https://razib.substack.com/p/you-cant-take-it-with-you-straight))  
This article clarifies epigenetics as a molecular process for gene regulation within lifetimes, debunking its role in transmitting trauma across generations due to resets in mammals. Key points critique media sensationalism and highlight biological constraints. Examples like Swedish famine studies show correlations but lack causation. I would point out that understanding epigenetics grounds us in science, avoiding overhyped claims about inherited experiences.

**Status Explains Lots** ([overcomingbias.com](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/10/status-explains-lots.html))  
The essay posits status, via dominance and prestige, drives much human behavior in workplaces, education, governance, and mating. Key points include framing bosses as prestigious to enable obedience and schools habituating prestige-based practices. Examples from BDSM preferences reflect status in mating. I would suggest this lens reveals why we resist domination yet accept it in modern forms.

**Rational Romantic Relationships** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JYckkCqhZPrdScjBx/rational-romantic-relationships-part-1-relationship-styles))  
This post applies rational thinking to relationships, covering styles and attraction basics from a science-based perspective. Key points emphasize evidence over intuition for better outcomes. I would note it's a practical framework for navigating love with clarity.

## Academic Research & Science

**Credit Scores, Cardiovascular Disease Risk, and Human Capital** ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4260546/))  
In a longitudinal study of 1,037 individuals from birth to age 38, low credit scores correlated with higher cardiovascular disease risk, with each 100-point score difference linked to a 13-month heart age gap. Methodology used structural equation modeling on the Dunedin cohort, testing hypotheses on shocks, income, and human capital. Human capital factors like education and self-control explained 45% of the link, with childhood factors accounting for 22%. Sample data: credit scores mean 675.2 (SD 168.6), heart age mean 38.5 (SD 8.0). Conclusions suggest credit scores reflect enduring human capital histories. I would highlight implications for privacy, as scores reveal sensitive traits without consent.

**In-Person Schooling and Youth Suicide** ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30795))  
This paper analyzes youth suicides (ages 12-18), finding they peak during school months and drop in summer, with regions starting school earlier showing higher rates. Methodology used school calendars and pandemic closures for causal insights. Key data: suicides highest in school year, areas with early starts had elevated rates. Conclusions link schooling to increased suicide risk, possibly via stress. I would observe this underscores education's hidden costs on mental health.

**Ongoing Trends of Human Intelligence** ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289622000897))  
Recent studies show positive Flynn effects (IQ gains) in developing countries but trivial or negative in advanced ones, with a "Great Convergence" narrowing global IQ gaps (e.g., 19 points between East Asia and South Asia). Methodology reviewed post-2010 studies and PISA data from 48 countries (2000-2018). Conclusions predict reduced cognitive disparities, tied to economic convergence. I would note this challenges assumptions about sustained high intelligence in prosperous societies.

**The Intergenerational Transmission of Human Capital** ([aaltodoc.aalto.fi](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/118511))  
Using 1940 census data on families with teenage children, the study finds school quality affects upward mobility in educational attainment, driven by selection into better schools and direct effects. Conclusions emphasize education's role in human capital transmission during upward mobility's golden age. I would remark on its relevance to ongoing debates about educational equity.

**Genes, Ideology, and Sophistication** ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/article/abs/genes-ideology-and-sophistication/91C7C343BBA8801732F62E7D55B16676))  
Minnesota Twin Study data show conservatism heritability at 74% for the most informed public fifth, versus 57% population-level and 29% for the bottom half. Methodology used structural equation modeling on sophistication-stratified twins. Conclusions resolve tensions, showing knowledge facilitates genetic expression in politics. I would suggest this illuminates ideology's biological roots.

**Low-Dose Radiation from A-Bombs Elongated Lifespan** ([genesenvironment.biomedcentral.com](https://genesenvironment.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41021-018-0114-3))  
Reexamining A-bomb data, low-dose radiation showed hormesis effects, extending lifespan and reducing cancer mortality versus un-irradiated. Methodology critiqued LNT hypothesis using LSS cohort (120,321 survivors). Key data: longer lifespans for survivors, J-shaped dose-response. Conclusions invalidate LNT, implying policy revisions to avoid unnecessary losses. I would point out this challenges radiation fears.

**Teacher Shortages: A Framework** ([edworkingpapers.com](https://www.edworkingpapers.com/ai22-684))  
Framework predicts localized shortages, with Tennessee 2019 data showing variation by school/subject. Factors like attrition and working conditions drive vacancies. Conclusions stress local perspectives for solutions. I would note its utility for education policy.
