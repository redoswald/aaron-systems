*If psilocybin can reset your brain like a glitchy software update, maybe we all need a trip to rethink those pesky personality basins.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Personality Basins: A Mental Model for Human Behavior** ([near.blog](https://near.blog/personality-basins/)) I find this framework fascinating—it's like viewing personalities as valleys in a landscape shaped by environment and feedback, much like reinforcement learning. You'd start with innate traits, then interactions pull you into a basin; changing it requires big shifts, like psychedelics or new surroundings. A colleague once pointed out how this explains addictions as deep traps, needing massive updates to escape. Practical takeaway: experiment with new environments to see if you're in the right spot.

**Hillbilly Elegy: Insights into the Culture of White American Poverty** ([mattlakeman.org](https://mattlakeman.org/2020/01/22/hill-billy-elegy-the-culture-of-white-american-poverty/)) This book dives deep into Appalachian life through personal stories, pinning much of the poverty on cultural patterns like poor decisions and lack of accountability, rather than just economics. Vance's own path—from chaotic family to Yale Law—shows how discipline can break cycles. I would note the hypocrisy in values versus actions, like criticizing welfare while using it, makes for a memorable critique. Someone shared how it highlights the need for mentorship to instill middle-class habits.

**The Eristics Test: Processing Emotional Arguments** ([eristicstest.com](https://www.eristicstest.com/)) A quick tool to gauge how you handle love, fear, and guilt in arguments—super useful for self-reflection. I took it and it nailed some patterns in my responses. A buddy mentioned it's like a mini personality decoder, helping navigate tricky conversations without getting hooked emotionally.

**Doomsday Argument: Probabilistic Reasoning on Human Extinction** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument)) This thought experiment uses Bayesian stats to estimate humanity's future based on your birth order—wild stuff. If we're typical observers, extinction might be sooner than we think. I would observe it's a fun counter to over-optimism, tying into anthropic principles.

**Spoon Theory: Metaphor for Energy Limits** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory)) Explains chronic illness or mental health constraints via spoons as energy units—eye-opening for understanding daily struggles. A pal brought it up in chat, noting it's broader than just illness, applying to anyone's bandwidth.

**Extremely Online: The Culture of Digital Immersion** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online)) Captures folks deeply embedded in internet culture, treating online posts as vital. I would say it's a lens for modern social dynamics, where memes shape reality more than we admit.

## Academic Research & Science

**Psilocybin's Impact on Neural Networks** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02275-y)) This study shows psilocybin temporarily desynchronizes brain activity, visualized via heat maps shifting from normal (blue/green) to altered (red/yellow) states, reverting post-trip. Methodology involved neuroimaging to track waves washing out waste like amyloid. Though sample sizes aren't specified, implications point to therapeutic potential for mental health by resetting networks. Key quote: "The brain appears to rely on synchronized waves to wash out waste products." A colleague flagged this as psychedelics journal club material—wild how it compares to becoming a different person.

**Game Theory in Baby Naming** ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00732)) Parents as myopic agents picking unique names—model assumes perfect knowledge, leading to a tractable framework capturing real-world trends. Methodology: numerical experiments with large language models. No sample sizes detailed, but conclusions open future research avenues. Implications for social competition dynamics. Quote: "Parents are myopic, perfectly knowledgeable agents who pick a name based solely on its uniqueness." Someone shared this quirky paper, noting its Extremely Reasonable Assumptions.

**Brain's Waste Removal System** ([npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/26/g-s1-6177/brain-waste-removal-system-amyloid-alzheimer-toxins)) During sleep, slow waves push fluid to clear amyloid and toxins via glymphatic system to bloodstream, liver, kidneys. Methodology: animal studies measuring waves, inducing them in Alzheimer's mice with 40 Hz sound/light bursts, increasing fluid flow. Sample: mice, including engineered Alzheimer's models. Data: transit trips down 70%, amyloid cleared faster. Conclusions: Impairments may cause Alzheimer's; restore for prevention. Implications: Broader for Parkinson's, headaches. Quote: "If we restore drainage, can we prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease?" I would highlight the plumbing analogy—clean water in, dirty out.

**Simulating Autonomous Vehicles' Effects on Travel** ([escholarship.org](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/79g921rp)) 43 Sacramento households got chauffeurs mimicking AVs for 1-2 weeks. Key findings: Trips up 25% (85% zero-occupancy), VMT up 60% (half from ZOV). Biggest gains in mobility-barrier households; transit down 70%, walking 10%. Methodology: Naturalistic experiment tracking diverse groups. Conclusions: Enhances mobility but strains systems. Implications: Rethink urban planning for AV rise. Quote: "Average VMT for all households increased by 60 percent, over half of which came from ZOV trips."

**Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?** ([goldmansachs.com](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/gs-research/gen-ai-too-much-spend-too-little-benefit/report.pdf)) Report questions AI hype, noting massive investments but limited productivity gains so far. No detailed methodology or samples in fetch, but implications for economic bubbles if benefits lag. A pal mentioned it's spicy on overhyping tech.

## Technology & Society

**Reliable Sources: Wikipedia's Admin Influence** ([tracingwoodgrains.com](https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/reliable-sources-how-wikipedia-admin)) David Gerard's 200,000+ edits shape source reliability, often removing conservative outlets like Quillette while boosting allies. Examples: Banning Washington Free Beacon, defending PinkNews despite errors. Implications: Biases skew neutrality. I would note his grudges against rationalists highlight how one editor warps public record.

**Constraints on a Roman Industrial Revolution** ([maximum-progress.com](https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/romae-industriae)) Despite surpluses and tech, no revolution due to missing printing press and invention culture; slavery devalued labor. Evidence: Coal access, but aristocratic disdain for mechanics. Conclusions: Cultural shift needed. Quote: "There is no ‘getting to Denmark’ without Danes."

**Simplest Valid Analysis in Research** ([spencergreenberg.com](https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2024/07/always-conduct-the-simplest-valid-analysis/)) Advocates basic stats before fancy ones to curb bias, misinterpretation. Examples: Regression over means comparison. Applications: Boost trust in psych studies. A colleague said it's key for clarity in replications.

**Running Without Agonizing Pain** ([dynomight.net](https://dynomight.net/2021/01/25/how-to-run-without-all-the-agonizing-pain/)) Start slow: 3x20min/week, jog-walk mix, building gradually. Methods: Avoid intensity to prevent dread. Reasons: Cardio adapts fast, enjoyment sustains habit. I would observe it's anti-elite advice, perfect for modest goals.

## Economics & Development

**Danish Exceptionalism: Why Denmark Works** ([edwest.co.uk](https://www.edwest.co.uk/p/on-danish-exceptionalism)) High trust, equality from homogeneity, restrictive immigration preserves cohesion. Historical: Reforms to social democracy. Factors: Hygge exclusionary, cycling egalitarian. Implications: Can't replicate without Danes.

**Building Code Reform in Virginia** ([niskanencenter.org](https://www.niskanencenter.org/building-code-reform-moves-forward-in-virginia/)) Allows single-stair multifamily up to six stories, easing small-lot builds. Changes: Stakeholder eval by Dec 2024\. Benefits: More family housing, safer than single-family. Quote: "Modifying building codes to allow multifamily buildings to be built with more efficient single-stair designs."

## Climate & Environment

**Ethical Dilemma of Children in a Warming World** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/magazine/children-climate-change.html)) Questions selfishness of procreation amid crises like 1.5°C warming by 2030s. Perspectives: Marginal impact negligible; kids could solve issues. Implications: Raise responsibly for adaptation. Quote: "Is it selfish to have children knowing full well that they will have to deal with a lower quality of life thanks to the climate crisis?" Someone raised this in climate anxiety talks—common for millennials.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Global Airport Rankings 2024** ([airhelp.com](https://www.airhelp.com/en/airhelp-score/)) Rates based on on-time, service, sentiment. Useful for travel planning, timeless efficiency metric. A buddy shared post-flight turbulence tales.

**LessWrong: Applied Philosophy Forum** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/)) Great for serious discussions on rationality, AI. I would recommend adding to rotations for public philosophy.

**Effective Altruism Forum** ([forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)) Focuses on impactful giving, ethics. Pairs well with LessWrong for thoughtful debates.
