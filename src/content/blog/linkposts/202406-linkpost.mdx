*Who knew that fascism could be explained through high school archetypes – jocks and creeps uniting in a bizarre ideological bromance?*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Social Behavior Curves and Radicalism** ([ericneyman.wordpress.com](https://ericneyman.wordpress.com/2021/06/05/social-behavior-curves-equilibria-and-radicalism/)) This essay models how social behaviors spread through populations using curves that plot individual willingness to adopt a behavior against the percentage of others doing it, leading to stable equilibria where behaviors stick or fade. Key concepts include S-shaped curves for network effects and equilibria analyzed via intersections with a diagonal line, with examples like mask-wearing showing how persuasion can trigger cascades from 50% to 65% adoption. The methodology involves hypothetical scenarios, such as video calls where 9 out of 20 participants end up with cameras on, and implications highlight the need for radicals to explore new ideas while conformists maintain cohesion. I would observe that this framework echoes real-world shifts, like rapid cultural changes in attitudes toward homosexuality, reminding me of those fall COVID hypotheticals where small nudges lead to big societal flips.

**People Unlike Me and Ideological Biases** ([notonyourteam.co.uk](https://www.notonyourteam.co.uk/p/people-unlike-me)) Exploring how political ideologies often align with the personality traits of their proponents, this piece argues that traits like high conscientiousness and low agreeableness lead to policies favoring a "self-control aristocracy," as seen in libertarianism's push for maximal freedom that benefits the disciplined but harms others. Examples include feminism suiting career-focused women who deprioritize family, with polls showing women desiring three children on average but having fewer, and wokery appealing to high-intellect, low-conscientious individuals demanding accommodations. Implications stress "mind-blindness" in governance, urging empathy for unlike others to avoid dud policies. I would point out that this mirrors my own classical liberal leanings, potentially biased by my spot in that aristocracy, much like the author's wife mastering R programming post-work while I struggle with similar discipline.

**The Jock-Creep Theory of Fascism** ([unpopularfront.news](https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-jockcreep-theory-of-fascism)) This theory categorizes fascism into "Jock-Douche" (confident, action-oriented) and "Creep-Loser" (resentful, fantastical) archetypes, synthesizing physical dominance with humiliation, as seen in Mussolini's anti-intellectual violence versus Hitler's pseudo-intellectual marginality. Historical examples include Mussolini's bone-breaking program and Himmler's philistine eugenics, with data from occult roots in völkisch groups involving 1912 rituals. Implications suggest fascism's silly-sinister duality persists today, like Trump's jock appeal over DeSantis's creep intellectualism. I would suggest this lens clarifies why fascism blends brute force with wounded fantasies, evoking those Brooklyn firehouse origins but in a darker ideological twist.

## Academic Research & Science

**The Weird Nerd and Trade-Offs in Talent** ([writingruxandrabio.com](https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/p/the-weird-nerd-comes-with-trade-offs)) A metascience exploration of how academia filters out "Weird Nerds" – those with intellectual courage but poor political skills – using Katalin Karikó's mRNA struggles as a case, where she faced grant denials despite her genius, with data showing biomedical scientists getting first grants at age 42 in 2011 versus 36 in the 1980s. Reasoning contrasts PhD skills (nerd-friendly) with PI demands (political), implying institutions must embrace trade-offs to retain talent or risk plummeting trust per Gallup polls. I would highlight how this hits close to home, like pondering autism tests amid casual chats, underscoring that genius like Karikó's requires pro-Weird Nerd norms to flourish without office games.

**RAADS-R Autism Diagnostic Scale** ([embrace-autism.com](https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/)) This tool assesses autism in adults via 80 self-report items across subscales like Social relatedness (threshold 31\) and Sensory-motor (16), with a total score over 65 indicating likely autism, validated on 66 autistic and 276 controls showing 97% sensitivity. Key findings include average autistic scores around 149, with implications for late diagnoses amid masking, though clinicians should verify. I would note scoring an 83 myself, landing between minimum autism consideration and stronger indications, tying into those group convos about neurodivergence without forcing formality.

## Technology & Society

**Blog Microfeatures for Better Sites** ([danilafe.com](https://danilafe.com/blog/blog_microfeatures/)) Detailing small enhancements like sidenotes for citations (inspired by Gwern's hydrocephalus page) and auto-generated TOCs in Hugo, this post lists features such as linkable headings and series grouping, with examples from Faster than Lime's Rust futures article. Implications include improved readability without major overhauls, like progress bars complementing TOCs. I would add that these tweaks remind me of SQL table merges or performance reviews, where small structural changes boost flow, especially in personal sites avoiding vague outputs.

**US Sunscreen Regulations and Health Risks** ([msnbc.com](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sunscreen-united-states-fda-ingredients-rcna153526)) Arguing FDA's drug-like regulation delays better ingredients, leading to inferior UVA protection where many US sunscreens fail European standards, tied to rising melanoma with over 100,000 potential lives saved from faster approvals like COVID tests. Implications advocate peer-approval reciprocity, as Europeans use more pleasant formulas likely applied more often. I would observe this echoes FDA critiques, like tainted applesauce, pushing for reforms without sawdust-era regressions.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Budget Travel Strategies Guide** ([tycoonstory.com](https://www.tycoonstory.com/national-debt-reliefs-smart-travelers-guide-how-to-see-the-world-on-a-budget/)) Outlining tips like off-peak travel and local cooking to cut costs, with expert insights from Marc Russell on ten countries, emphasizing smarter journeys over cheap ones. Practical applications include fare alerts and free activities like markets, implying financial prudence enables enriching experiences. I would remark that this aligns with Banff planning or hostel hunts, transforming budgets into cultural connections without debt worries.

**Lake Waubeeka Community History** ([newstimes.com](https://www.newstimes.com/living/slideshow/Vintage-photos-Lake-Waubeeka-community-formed-70-221340.php)) Chronicling a 1951 Jewish firefighters' summer village in Danbury, bought for $90,000 on 600 acres with $10 bungalow deposits, evolving from basic ranches to custom homes. Timelines span 1950 land ad to 1960s swim teams, implying enduring community bonds amid New York's heat escapes. I would reflect on this as a quirky curiosity, like pondering shacks or ethnic quotas, capturing that government-won't-allow vibe in historical hideaways.

## Politics & Current Events (2024)

**Satirical 2024 Presidential Debate Transcript** ([astralcodexten.com](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/my-2024-presidential-debate)) A humorous take where Biden doubts states' existence and Trump likens them to atomic aspects, with absurd agreements on abortion (excluding C-sections), cancel culture as fertility rites, and immigration via spiritual rivers. Commentary satirizes debate absurdity, implying blurred policy lines amid spectacle. I would chuckle that this captures the morbid excitement of real debates, like post-debate odds shifts, without actual bone-breaking.

**OpenAI Whistleblowers and Safety Concerns** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/technology/openai-culture-whistleblowers.html)) Nine insiders accuse OpenAI of prioritizing A.G.I. profits over safety, using nondisparagement to silence critics, with over $80 million in federal funding implicated. Implications call for transparency amid ChatGPT's rise. My buddy would highlight this amid visa chats, noting the reckless race like FSU rankings or house buys.

**COVID Lab Leak Risks Opinion** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html)) Arguing Wuhan's lab research under BSL-2 likely caused the outbreak, with furin site matching unfunded Defuse proposals, no market animals infected, and 25 million deaths. Implications urge safety reforms. I would emphasize this intolerable risk, akin to shack dreams or perfect weather gripes, demanding accountability.

**Biden Border Executive Action** ([cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-administration-border-executive-action/index.html)) Announcing asylum limits via 212f authority, amid falling arrests and Mexico's help, to counter GOP attacks pre-debate. Implications tighten policy despite bipartisan blocks. I would connect this to utility sheds or unpowered living debates, fighting for resources amid government hurdles.

**Tainted Applesauce Lead Recall** ([cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tainted-lead-applesauce-wanabana-recall-cinnamon-carlos-aguilera-accused/)) Ecuadorian processor Aguilera blamed for lead in pouches poisoning 413 kids (median age 2), with levels at 25.4 micrograms/dl, likely economic adulteration. Implications limit FDA foreign reach. I would lament this toxic slip, echoing sunscreen or FDA rants, eroding faith in kid snacks.
