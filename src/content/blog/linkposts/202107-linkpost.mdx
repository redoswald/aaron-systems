*Who knew lifting weights could make your fat cells start spilling the tea on burning calories?*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Does Moral Philosophy Actually Drive Progress?** ([applieddivinitystudies.com](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/progress-moral/))  
This essay questions whether investing in moral philosophy accelerates societal progress, using counterexamples like the persistence of factory farming despite ancient ethical teachings against animal harm, and the economic drivers behind slavery's abolition rather than pure moral arguments. It notes correlations between human rights advancements and GDP growth, suggesting economic factors may be more influential. I would note that this challenges the comforting idea that past atrocities stemmed from ignorance, implying we often knowingly commit wrongs today.

## Academic Research & Science

**Weight Training's Surprising Impact on Fat Cells** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/well/move/weight-training-fat.html))  
This article details a study on mice and humans showing that resistance exercise prompts muscles to release genetic material in bubbles that signal fat cells to burn stored energy, with effects lasting up to 24 hours post-workout. Methodology involved molecular analysis of cellular crosstalk, though specific sample sizes aren't detailed; prior studies referenced include groups like young women and overweight men. I would observe that this reshapes how we view lifting—not just for muscle, but as a direct metabolic hack for fat loss.

**The Deadliest U.S. Disasters Might Surprise You** ([prb.org](https://www.prb.org/resources/which-types-of-disasters-are-the-deadliest-in-the-u-s-the-answer-is-surprising/))  
Research from 1970-2004 analyzed 19,959 natural disaster deaths, finding heat/drought caused 19.6% (3,906 deaths), followed by severe summer weather (18.8%) and winter weather (18.1%), while hurricanes and wildfires accounted for only 5%. Using a spatial hazard database, it mapped high-risk areas like the South Atlantic coast. A colleague would point out the implications for resource allocation, as common events like heat waves kill more over time than dramatic catastrophes.

**1972 MIT Collapse Prediction Holds Up** ([vice.com](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xw3x/new-research-vindicates-1972-mit-prediction-that-society-will-collapse-soon))  
Updating the 1972 "Limits to Growth" World3 model with recent data on variables like population and pollution, the 2020 study aligns closest with "business-as-usual" and "comprehensive technology" scenarios, predicting growth halt by 2030 and potential collapse by 2040 if unchecked. Methodology compared empirical data to model outputs; no specific sample sizes, as it's simulation-based. Someone shared this sobering update, noting it implies urgent shifts beyond endless growth for a sustainable future.

Exploring efforts to infuse AI with religious wisdom, the piece features initiatives like faith-based AI interactions and interfaith groups addressing biases and surveillance. Key examples include studies tailoring AI responses to spiritual queries and podcasts blending tech with theology. I would remark that this bridges secular tech culture with ancient moral frameworks, potentially countering harms like discrimination through humility and historical perspective.

**Musk's Mood on AI Safety** ([lukemuehlhauser.com](http://lukemuehlhauser.com/musks-non-missing-mood/))  
The post discusses Elon Musk's serious concern for AI risks, contrasting with many ML researchers' optimism, and argues for more focus on safety amid rapid advancements. A pal would note the implications for prioritizing existential threats in tech development.

**Visual Programming: Hacker News Insights** ([drossbucket.com](https://drossbucket.com/2021/06/30/hacker-news-folk-wisdom-on-visual-programming/))  
Compiling Hacker News comments, this explores why visual programming often fails despite promises, citing issues like scalability and abstraction. I would add that it connects to broader tech debates on tools versus text-based efficiency.

## Economics & Development

**The Hidden Costs of Master's Degrees** ([slate.com](https://slate.com/business/2021/07/masters-degrees-debt-loans-worth-it.html))  
Analyzing how elite schools profit from master's programs, often leaving students with high debt (e.g., $300k for arts degrees) and low returns, especially online via revenue-sharing with managers. Implications call for loan caps and transparency. A buddy would observe the scam-like blurring of nonprofit and for-profit education.

**Rethinking ESG Investing** ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/socially-responsible-investing-11624288038))  
As more funds flow into ESG, investors demand both values alignment and strong returns, amid growing trends. I would note this shifts investing toward balancing profit with positive impact, though data on performance remains key.

**Co-ops and Founder Incentives** ([jrwiener.com](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-and-founder-incentives/))  
Examining how cooperatives can better align incentives for founders through shared ownership, potentially fostering sustainable business models. Someone would highlight its practical applications for equitable development.
