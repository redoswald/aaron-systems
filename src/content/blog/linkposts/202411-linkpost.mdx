*Who knew a prison could come with beach views? Norway's making incarceration look like a vacation while we're still figuring out shoplifting stats in NYC.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**The Ideal of Gentlemanly Conduct: Kalos Kagathos** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalos_kagathos))  
I would note that this ancient Greek concept of the "beautiful and good" resonates with modern discussions on character and virtue. It combines physical beauty with moral goodness, often in a military context, and was a staple in the works of Plato and Aristotle. My buddy brought this up in a chat about societal values, highlighting how it underscores a crisis in holistic personal development today. It's a reminder that true excellence isn't just about looks or ethics in isolation, but their harmonious blend.

## Academic Research & Science

**Virologist Self-Treats Cancer with Lab-Grown Viruses** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03647-0))  
Virologist Beata Halassy self-treated her cancer using viruses she grew in the lab, reporting positive results, but researchers warn against others attempting it due to risks. The methodology involved her personal application of virotherapy, though details on sample size aren't applicable as it's a single case. Key findings include successful treatment and a positive experience, with implications raising bioethical concerns about self-experimentation and the need for regulated trials. I would highlight how this challenges traditional medical boundaries—why are bioethicists so out of tune with intuitive human responses to illness? A colleague shared this, noting it's a bold push against conventional norms.

**The Deepening Scandal of Fraud in Business Schools** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/01/business-school-fraud-research/680669/))  
This article exposes widespread data fraud in business school research, with examples like Francesca Gino's 138 studies under scrutiny, where manipulated data in papers like "Don’t Stop Believing" (retracted 2023\) showed suspicious heart-rate patterns in 167 students. Detection involved audits and statistical analysis, revealing swapped data in experiments with 43 participants. Implications point to weaker standards in business psychology, incentivizing flashy findings and risking careers. I would observe that this rot in academia warns us about trusting "experts" blindly—my friend flagged this as an indictment of how incentives warp knowledge production.

**Preregistration's Limits in Ensuring Scientific Credibility** ([cremieux.xyz](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/preregistration-is-no-panacea))  
Preregistration, meant to curb analytical flexibility, falls short as seen in a failed replication of a study on thoughts of God increasing AI acceptance (original: 2,462 participants, replication: 4,143, effect sizes near zero). Criticisms include vague protocols allowing deviations; implications urge stricter registered reports for honest results, like those from EEF showing small effects (0.06 SD). I would point out that even safeguards like this can't save irrelevant research—it's memorable for exposing how science often chases shadows.

**Bimodal Compensation in Developer Salaries** ([danluu.com](https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/))  
Developer pay has skyrocketed post-wage-fixing agreements, with new grad salaries from $50k to $250k (2015 data, \~100 points). Reasons include talent shortages and immigration barriers; implications suggest potential normalization as CS enrollments rise. I would note this mirrors power-law distributions in competitive fields—it's useful for understanding why some thrive while others don't.

**Rising Early-Onset Cancers in Younger Adults** ([yalemedicine.org](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/early-onset-cancer-in-younger-people-on-the-rise))  
Early-onset cancers (ages 18-49) are increasing, with incidence rising 1-2% annually (1995-2020), colorectal leading deaths in men under 50\. Causes unclear, but genetics explain 20%; implications stress family history for earlier screenings. I would comment that this trend is concerning, especially with aggressive forms—my pal shared it amid talks on health interventions.

**Misinformation on Mpox Risks in Tweets by Health Experts** ([medrxiv.org](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.11.23289839v1))  
Analysis of 262 tweets (May-Oct 2022\) showed 82% inaccurate, all exaggerating risks to kids in schools; credentialed users 4.6x more likely to mislead. Methodology: retrospective search; implications highlight amplification of errors via retweets. I would say this underscores why we can't blindly trust experts—they're prone to bias too.

**Physical Activity Levels Among U.S. Adults** ([cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db443.htm))  
From 2020 NHIS data (complex sample design), 24.2% met aerobic and strength guidelines; men (28.3%) \> women (20.4%), decreasing with age. Methodology: self-reported; implications for public health push better adherence. It's a solid reference for why activity matters long-term.

## Technology & Society

**Doing Things That Don't Scale in Startups** ([paulgraham.com](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html))  
Paul Graham advises manual user recruitment and delighting early adopters, like Airbnb's door-to-door efforts or Stripe's instant setups. Implications: unscalable actions ignite growth. I would note this as timeless startup wisdom—practical for building from scratch.

## Economics & Development

**Advocating for Consumption Taxes in Tax Reform** ([cremieux.xyz](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/trump-should-finish-what-he-started))  
Consumption taxes (e.g., DBCFT) promote growth by not penalizing savings; data shows 15% returns preserved vs. eroded under income taxes. Methodology: economic models like Hall-Jorgensen. Implications: simplify policy, boost investment. I would highlight its potential to reform inefficient systems.

**Immigration's Impact on the U.S. Macroeconomy Post-2024** ([brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/immigration-and-the-macroeconomy-after-2024/))  
Projections: Trump low scenario nets \-740k migration (2025), reducing GDP growth 0.5pp; Harris high adds 3.7m. Data: 3.3m net 2024\. Implications: lower immigration disrupts labor, favors reform. A friend noted its relevance to policy debates.

**Profile of Unauthorized Immigrants in the U.S.** ([pewresearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/))  
11m in 2022 (up from 10.5m), 8.3m workforce; Mexico down to 4m. Methodology: residual method. Implications: informs debates on integration. Useful for understanding demographic shifts.

**Notes on Guyana's History and Development** ([mattlakeman.org](https://mattlakeman.org/2024/11/08/notes-on-guyana/))  
Guyana's colonial past, ethnic tensions, and oil boom (11b barrels) drive GDP from $5.2b (2019) to $16.8b (2023). Implications: resource curse risks amid corruption. I would say it's a fascinating case of rapid change.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Understanding Retarded Potentials in Electrodynamics** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_potential))  
Retarded potentials account for light-speed propagation; equations include Lorenz gauge integrals. Applications: satellite orbits, galaxy curves. I would note its curiosity in linking physics concepts—shared in a random chat.

## Politics & Current Events (2024)

**Concentrated Shoplifting Arrests in NYC** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/nyregion/shoplifting-arrests-nyc.html))  
327 people accounted for a third of arrests, rearrested 6,000+ times; 18 stores/7 pharmacies for 20% complaints. Implications: repeat offenders drive crime stats. I would say this simplistic model of good vs. bad people fits—shared amid crime talks.

**Fluoride Levels Linked to Lower IQ in Children** ([npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5086886/fluoride-and-iq))  
NIH report (300+ pages, global studies) links 1.5mg/L fluoride to IQ drops (few points in studies); affects 2m in U.S. Implications: more research on low levels. My colleague debated trade-offs with tooth decay.

**Shifts in U.S. Voter Demographics Across Elections** ([cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/))  
Trump improved across groups; Latino men shifted right, younger voters to Trump. Implications: economy drove changes. A buddy pointed this out post-election.

**Analyzing Prison's Impact on Crime Reduction** ([astralcodexten.com](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prison-and-crime-much-more-than-you))  
Each prisoner-year prevents 1 violent/6 property crimes; deterrence weak. Implications: cost-benefit mixed. I would note Norway's model contrasts nicely.

**Norway's Humane Prison Approach at Bastoy** ([weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2017/06/this-norwegian-prison-is-the-nicest-in-the-world))  
Bastoy offers beaches, activities; 20% recidivism vs. 50%+ U.S. Implications: responsibility-focused reform works. It's memorable for rethinking punishment.

**Inflation's Role in Shaping Voter Sentiment** ([jzmazlish.substack.com](https://jzmazlish.substack.com/p/yes-inflation-made-the-median-voter))  
Median wages lagged; 81% feel prices outpace wages. Implications: drove election outcomes. I would observe it's a red herring ignoring broader ethics.

**Cautious Optimism Post-Election** ([benthams.substack.com](https://benthams.substack.com/p/dont-freak-out-about-the-election))  
8 reasons not to panic: uncertainty, global progress. Implications: focus on positives. My friend would note it's virtuous to invest in lives.

**Trump's Interview Transcript on Policies** ([time.com](https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/))  
Trump discusses deportations, tariffs. Implications: signals policy directions. Shared in context of crime debates.

**Reconsidering Indigenous Land Acknowledgments** ([noahpinion.blog](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/no-you-are-not-on-indigenous-land))  
Land belongs to institutions, not races; acknowledgments ethnonationalist. Implications: avoid divisive claims. A pal sent this, noting territorial complexities.

**A Manifesto for Common Sense Democrats** ([slowboring.com](https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto))  
9 principles: growth \+ safety net, judge by character. Implications: broaden appeal. I would say it's a rhythm-breaking call for balance.

**The Sociological Rise of Christianity** ([astralcodexten.com](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/book-review-the-rise-of-christianity))  
40% decadal growth via networks; fertility, plagues aided. Implications: social dynamics drive change. It's useful for understanding movements.
