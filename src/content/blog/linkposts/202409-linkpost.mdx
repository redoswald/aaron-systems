*In Megalopolis, a live actor chats with Adam Driver on screen—because nothing says 'cinematic innovation' like turning the audience into unpaid extras.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Decoupling vs Contextualising Norms** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms))  
This post explores the tension between decoupling (analyzing statements in isolation) and contextualizing (considering broader implications), noting how these norms lead to misunderstandings. I would observe that this framework explains a lot of modern conflicts, where one side fences off threats while the other sees it as lacking empathy—much like debates in our group chats that spiral from facts into feelings.

**MIRI's Death with Dignity Strategy** ([lesswrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy))  
Eliezer Yudkowsky's announcement that MIRI is shifting from AI alignment research to advocating for a global pause on AI development, framed as accepting defeat gracefully. I would note the humor in this pivot, reminding me of those moments when we realize a debate's gone too far and it's time to bow out—though in this case, it's about humanity's survival.

**Calvinism as Recovered High-Trust Agency** ([benjaminrosshoffman.com](https://benjaminrosshoffman.com/calvinism-as-a-theory-of-recovered-high-trust-agency/))  
An exploration of Calvinism as a mechanism for rebuilding trust and agency in low-trust environments through predestination and community norms. I would highlight how this resonates with our discussions on social constructs, like how placebo effects or societal pressures shape behavior without us noticing.

**Levels of Republicanism** ([benjaminrosshoffman.com](https://benjaminrosshoffman.com/levels-of-republicanism/))  
A breakdown of republicanism from basic civic participation to advanced forms like profitable partial exit from perverse regimes. I would comment that this tiers system feels like a strategy guide for navigating flawed systems, akin to our talks on optimizing life hacks in a broken world.

**The Awakening by Kate Chopin** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Awakening_(Chopin_novel)))  
Kate Chopin's novel about a woman's self-discovery and societal rebellion in 19th-century Louisiana. My pal shared this in a chat about translating mom-speak, noting the demure dress—it's a classic on awakening to personal desires amid constraints, which ties into our fertility norm debates.

**Freyja: Norse Goddess of Love and War** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freyja))  
The Norse goddess associated with love, fertility, war, and magic. A buddy dropped this during a video call setup, perhaps linking to themes of power and influence—reminds me how ancient myths mirror modern discussions on human nature's dualities.

**Why Should I Specifically Care?** ([open.substack.com](https://open.substack.com/pub/rantstofriends/p/why-should-i-specifically-care))  
A rewritten note on moral obligations, using scenarios like ignoring hungry children to question why we should care about distant issues. I shared this amid talks on fertility and ethics, observing how it stacks references to probe personal vs. global responsibilities.

## Academic Research & Science

**Placebo Interventions for All Clinical Conditions** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20091554/))  
This Cochrane review analyzed 202 trials across 60 conditions, finding no important clinical effects from placebos overall, but possible influences on patient-reported outcomes like pain (SMD \-0.28, 95% CI \-0.36 to \-0.19) and nausea. Methodology involved searching multiple databases (up to 2008) and including randomized trials with no-treatment controls; sample sizes were 6,041 for binary outcomes and 10,525 for continuous. Conclusions note variations explained by trial design, implying limited clinical use but value in understanding bias. I would note this backs my earlier claim that placebos are overhyped, much like our group's skepticism on socially constructed ailments.

**Placebo and Nocebo Effects in Pharmacological Interventions** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37848293/))  
This umbrella review synthesizes evidence on placebo and nocebo effects in drug trials, but details are limited as the content focuses on unrelated aspects; key takeaway is methodological flaws in older studies. A colleague shared this critiquing outdated views, aligning with our chats on how comfort breeds weakness in society.

**Is the Placebo Powerless? Update with 52 New Trials** ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15257721/))  
Updating a systematic review with 156 trials and 11,737 patients, it found no large placebo effects, with small possible impacts on pain (SMD \-0.28) undistinguished from bias. Methodology used meta-analysis on binary (RR 0.95) and continuous outcomes (SMD \-0.24); low bias in only 8% of trials. Implications caution against overinterpreting placebo power. I posted this as evidence against placebo myths, tying into our SAD discussions as socially constructed.

**Mass Media and Fertility Change** ([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223858/))  
This chapter reviews associations between media access and fertility decline, with regressions showing TVs per 1,000 explaining 74% of variance across 144 countries. Methodology includes cross-sectional DHS surveys (samples 2,200–5,300 women) and interventions like Guatemala's radio campaign tripling vasectomy demand. Implications suggest media legitimizes smaller families. Someone shared this pre-social media era insight, noting it amplifies our Goonpocalypse theories on addictive media's fertility impact.

**Neanderthal DNA and Autism Susceptibility** ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02593-7))  
Analyzing WES from SPARK and GTEx datasets (e.g., 2004 white non-Hispanic autistics), it found rare Neanderthal SNPs enriched in autism (OR up to 7.624), with implications for brain development. Methodology used NeanderScores and functional enrichment for terms like "neurogenesis." I shared this linking autism to Neanderthal traits, joking science fiction is real.

**Autocracy, Democracy, and Economic Growth** ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05059))  
Using panel regressions on country-year data (e.g., N=6312), it shows democracy's growth effects vanish when controlling for Western favors like sanctions avoidance. Methodology includes 2SLS with democratization waves as instruments. Implications affirm favoring democracies economically works. Unrelated to convos, but I noted it supports U.S. policies aiding gay-friendly nations.

**Government-Subsidized Supermarket in Food Deserts** ([cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/assessment-of-a-governmentsubsidized-supermarket-in-a-highneed-area-on-household-food-availability-and-childrens-dietary-intakes/C998CF42FACEDADAE59D906CE63D04B7))  
Difference-in-differences with 2172 surveys showed minimal dietary improvements post-supermarket opening; salty snacks availability dropped 10% initially but unsustained. Sample: 363 dietary recalls. Implications: Access alone insufficient for health changes. I linked this showing food deserts interventions flop.

**Car Seats as Contraception** ([papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665046))  
Difference-in-differences on census data estimates car seat laws reduce third births by 0.73 percentage points, preventing 57 fatalities but 145,000 fewer births since 1980\. Implications: Safety regs unintendedly curb fertility. A friend shared noting effects on higher-income households.

**Neoadjuvant Oncolytic Virotherapy for Breast Cancer** ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/9/958))  
Single case: Self-administered viruses shrunk tumor from 2.47 to 0.91 cm³, enabling surgery; lymphocytic infiltration rose to 45%. Implications: OVT for downstaging tumors. I questioned this wild self-experiment.

CFPB spotlights Big Tech's payments dominance, $200B Apple Pay spend. A pal shared amid tap debates.

**Mastercard Contactless Payments Survey** ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/select/mastercard-survey-contactless-payments/))  
51% Americans use contactless, but most stick to cards. Implications: Phone taps lag.

**Gwern on Not Turning Sites into Books** ([gwern.net](https://gwern.net/book-writing))  
Explains why dynamic sites harm when bookified. I shared on writing, noting it harms flow.

## Economics & Development
