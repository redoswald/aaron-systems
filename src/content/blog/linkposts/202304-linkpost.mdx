## Philosophy & Human Nature

**The Snake Cult of Consciousness** ([vectors.substack.com](https://vectors.substack.com/p/the-snake-cult-of-consciousness)) This essay proposes a variant of the stoned ape theory, arguing that snake venom, rather than mushrooms, played a key role in evolving human consciousness through ancient psychedelic rituals around 15,000 years ago. Key arguments include the global prevalence of snakes in creation myths and iconography, such as at Gobekli Tepe where 28.4% of animal representations are snakes, and pharmacological evidence from a case report of a man using cobra venom for hallucinations similar to psilocybin. The ritual, possibly involving antivenoms like apples (rich in Rutin), is suggested to have spread memetically, enabling abstract thought and civilization. Implications include explaining cognitive modernity's global diffusion without genetic mutations, and linking schizophrenia to evolutionary remnants. I would note that this ties into timeless questions about the origins of self-awareness, much like ancient myths warning of knowledge's dangers.

**Rethinking Benevolent Sexism** ([aporiamagazine.com](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/rethinking-benevolent-sexism)) This article examines benevolent sexism, defined as valuing feminine attributes and traditional gender roles, contrasting it with hostile sexism. Key arguments challenge whether it's truly harmful, noting studies like Glick and Fiske (1997; 2001\) on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, and findings from Sibley and Becker (2012) showing it correlates with higher relationship satisfaction and less conflict. Data includes a Twitter survey (N=301 heterosexuals) replicating links to life satisfaction, with men scoring higher. Conclusions highlight a trade-off: it enhances relationships but may hinder women's ambition. Implications suggest positive interpersonal dynamics but barriers to gender equity. A pal shared this, noting how it flips the script on what we assume about gender roles—turns out, chivalry might not be dead, just misunderstood.

**IQ is Largely a Pseudoscientific Swindle** ([medium.com](https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39)) Nassim Taleb critiques IQ testing as unreliable, primarily measuring extreme unintelligence rather than true intelligence. Key arguments include mathematical flaws in correlations under fat tails, high retest variance (up to two standard deviations), and low predictive power (R² \<0.01 for income, 0.02 for wealth from Zagorsky 2007). Conclusions assert IQ explains \<2-13% of performance in test-like tasks, with national IQ data noisy (104/185 countries lacking studies). Implications warn against misuse for racial profiling or individual assessment, favoring task-specific evaluations. I would observe that this dismantles the myth of IQ as a destiny marker, reminding us real smarts show in the wild, not on paper.

**The Philosophy of Exploitation** ([plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/)) This entry defines exploitation as taking unfair advantage of another's vulnerability for personal benefit, exploring theories like Marxist labor value and Kantian respect for persons. Key discussions include whether exploitation requires harm (e.g., sweatshop debates) or can be mutual (e.g., surrogacy). Implications span ethics, economics, and politics, questioning if consensual transactions can still be exploitative. A colleague mentioned this in a chat about power dynamics—it's a reminder that even "fair" deals can hide imbalances worth unpacking.

**Reverse Dominance Hierarchies** ([robkhenderson.substack.com](https://robkhenderson.substack.com/p/reverse-dominance-hierarchies)) Reviewing Christopher Boehm's book, this piece argues hunter-gatherers maintained egalitarianism through "reverse dominance hierarchies," where subordinates collectively suppress alpha types via criticism, ostracism, or execution. Key findings: 97% of human history was egalitarian, with self-domestication reducing aggression (chimpanzees 150-550x more violent). Examples include \!Kung arrow-swapping to equalize credit and Yanomamo chiefs limited to suggestions. Implications: Explains communism's appeal but warns of despotic risks; envy, adaptive in bands, may hinder modern societies. I would note this echoes how small groups keep egos in check—timeless wisdom for any team or community.

## Academic Research & Science

**Sex Differences in the Brain: From Genes to Behavior** ([pnas.org](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1316909110)) This PNAS paper reviews sex differences in human behavior, finding adaptive complementarity: males excel in motor and spatial abilities, females in memory and social cognition. Methodology involves synthesizing studies on brain structure, function, and behavior, with sample sizes varying across cited works (e.g., large meta-analyses). Key data: Males show better throwing accuracy and mental rotation; females superior in episodic memory and face recognition. Conclusions: Differences arise from evolutionary pressures, not just socialization. Implications: Informs understanding of gender-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., autism in males, depression in females) and challenges blank slate views. A buddy shared this, highlighting how evolution wired us differently—redpill reality check.

**Business-Size Bias: Judging Negative Emotions** ([psyarxiv.com](https://psyarxiv.com/aujfy/)) This preprint investigates "business-size bias," where people are more dishonest towards big businesses than small ones, mediated by lower vulnerability perceptions. Methodology: Seven experiments (N=2,556) using scenarios and behavioral tasks. Key findings: Higher intent to deceive big firms (e.g., stealing more from chains), with vulnerability explaining 20-30% of effects. Conclusions: Big businesses face greater dishonesty risks. Implications: Suggests reputational strategies for large firms; questions anti-big business attitudes. Someone pointed this out in a discussion on ethics—turns out size does matter when it comes to moral shortcuts.

**Those Who Stayed: Individualism and Emigration** ([papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3321790)) This paper examines how emigration during Scandinavia's Age of Mass Migration (1850-1920) shifted sending regions towards collectivism via self-selection of individualists. Methodology: Analysis of historical censuses and passenger lists (large-scale, unspecified exact N). Key findings: Individualists migrate more due to lower network abandonment costs; cultural transmission pushes collectivism. Conclusions: Emigration causes cultural convergence. Implications: Explains migration's long-term cultural impacts on societies. I would remark that this shows how leaving reshapes home—wanderlust's hidden legacy.

**Book Review: The Arctic Hysterias** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-arctic-hysterias)) Reviewing Edward Foulks' book, this discusses Eskimo culture-bound disorders like piblokto (sudden violent outbursts) and kayak phobia. Methodology: Foulks' fieldwork in 1970s Alaska (small samples, e.g., 6 piblokto cases). Key findings: Disorders tied to shame culture and stress; piblokto declined with Westernization. Implications: Highlights cultural influences on mental health, questioning biological vs. social causes. A friend reacted with a heart—fascinating how isolation breeds unique minds.

**Parrots and Video Chat: A Feathered Social Experiment** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/21/science/parrots-video-chat-facetime.html)) This interactive piece details an experiment where 18 parrots learned to initiate video calls, showing engagement like mirroring behaviors and forming preferences. Methodology: Owners trained birds to ring bells for calls; observed over months. Key findings: Parrots calmer, more confident post-calls. Implications: Suggests tech can enrich pet lives, ethically if agency prioritized. I would chuckle at parrots "coming to life"—who knew birds crave Zoom too?

## Technology & Society

**Why I Am Not an AI Doomer** ([sarahconstantin.substack.com](https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-ai-doomer)) Sarah Constantin argues current ML won't soon yield x-risk AGI, agreeing AGI is possible but lacking agency for threats. Key arguments: AIs need causality and goal robustness, absent in LLMs. Implications: Advocate free development for benefits, oppose bans. A pal unsent a message nearby—makes you rethink the hype.

**The End of Giant AI Models Era** ([wired.com](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/)) Sam Altman states scaling giant models like GPT-4 (trillions of parameters, $100M+ training) is over due to limits; future via new architectures. Implications: Shift to human feedback tuning. I would note this pivots AI from brute force to finesse.

**Why Tool AIs Want to Be Agent AIs** ([gwern.net](https://gwern.net/tool-ai)) Gwern argues autonomous Agent AIs outperform passive Tool AIs economically and intellectually, as all problems are RL problems. Examples: YouTube's REINFORCE upgrade. Implications: Tool AIs unstable; agents inevitable. Someone reacted with love—eye-opener on AI evolution.

**I Owe My Career to the SAT** ([erikhoel.substack.com](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/i-owe-my-career-to-the-sat)) Erik Hoel credits high SAT for escaping humble roots, arguing tests less wealth-tied than extracurriculars. Data: 80%+ colleges test-optional for 2023\. Implications: De-emphasis limits mobility. I would say this levels the field—test prep beats privilege sometimes.

**The Age of Average** ([alexmurrell.co.uk](https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average)) Alex Murrell documents cultural homogenization: 80% cars monochromatic (2016 vs. 40% 1996), movie posters clichéd, 50%+ top films sequels. Causes: Globalization, testing. Implications: Stifles creativity. A buddy laughed—everything's blending into bland.

## Economics & Development

**America’s Economic Outperformance** ([economist.com](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/13/from-strength-to-strength)) This briefing praises U.S. economy despite declinism, noting 8% annual growth past five years, but warns of self-undermining via debt, inequality. Implications: Risks to success. Someone reacted with love—America's strength, warts and all.

**The New Deal and Recovery: Deposit Insurance** ([alt-m.org](https://www.alt-m.org/2023/03/28/the-new-deal-and-recovery-part-27-deposit-insurance/)) Details FDIC's 1933 creation, initial $2,500 coverage (raised to $100,000 by 1982). Effects: Reduced failures initially, but deregulation caused $36.6B losses 1980-1994. Implications: Moral hazard spikes risks. I would highlight how safety nets can backfire.

**Something Interesting in Tulsa** ([trevorklee.substack.com](https://trevorklee.substack.com/p/something-interesting-is-happening)) Trevor Klee observes billionaire-funded revitalization via GKFF ($4B+ assets), building parks, Tulsa Remote ($10K incentives). Implications: Philanthropy transforms cities faster than bureaucracy. A colleague shared—wealth reshaping rust belts.

**Japan’s Empty Houses Crisis** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/17/realestate/japan-empty-houses.html)) Over 10 million abandoned akiya due to shrinking population; example: $23,000 purchase renovated for $150,000. Implications: Strain on matching buyers, opportunities for foreigners. I would note demographics' silent toll—ghost towns ahead?

## Reference & Curiosities

**Negative Emotions and Mental Health** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/well/mind/negative-emotions-mental-health.html)) Study (N unspecified) finds judging negative emotions bad increases anxiety, depression; acceptance reduces suffering. Implications: Lean in for better well-being. I would say, embrace the blues—they're not the enemy.

**US Baby Names Dataset** ([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/us-baby-names)) Dataset for exploring U.S. naming trends. Implications: Cultural shifts in names over time. I would note patterns reveal societal changes—fascinating data dive.

**America’s Ur-Choropleths** ([kieranhealy.org](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2015/06/12/americas-ur-choropleths/)) Discusses how choropleth maps often reflect population density more than variables. Implications: Misleads interpretations; adjust for population. A pal sent—maps lie, but beautifully.

**Misuzulu Zulu: Zulu King** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuzulu_Zulu)) Profile on Zulu king Misuzulu kaZwelithini, third son of Goodwill Zwelithini. Implications: Modern monarchy dynamics. I would observe cultural continuity in leadership.

## Politics & Current Events (2023)

**The Global Elite’s Favorite Strongman: Paul Kagame** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/magazine/paul-kagame-rwanda.html)) Profile on Kagame's Rwanda reforms: 70% child mortality drop, 8% growth, health insurance. Moral hazards: Authoritarianism, Congo support. Implications: Aid vs. rights trade-offs. Low key, racists might admire him.

**The Subway is for Transportation** ([joshbarro.com](https://www.joshbarro.com/p/the-subway-is-for-transportation)) Argues LA Metro's usability declined due to drug use, homelessness; enforce rules via arrests. Data: 22 deaths since Jan, 24% crime rise. Implications: Prioritize transport over shelter. I would say, arrest to reclaim rails.

**Towards an Enlightened Centrism** ([richardhanania.com](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/towards-an-enlightened-centrism)) Recommends ECs like Klein, Pinker for traits like non-zero sum thinking. Implications: Better analysis beyond tribes. A friend noted—read widely for wisdom.

**Policing 'Evil': Witch-Hunting in Bénin** ([jstor.org](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41306028)) Jeffrey Kahn's paper on state-sponsored witch-hunting in Bénin (N unspecified), methodology: Historical analysis.
