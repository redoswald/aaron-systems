*In a world where one wrong word in a baptism can invalidate thousands of souls, maybe the Catholic Church should consider autocorrect for its rituals.*

## Philosophy & Human Nature

**Reasons and Persons: The Case Against the Self** ([dynomight.net](https://dynomight.net/no-self/))  
Derek Parfit's thought experiments in "Reasons and Persons" challenge traditional notions of personal identity through scenarios like teletransportation—where a machine scans and recreates your body on Mars, raising questions about whether it's transportation or death—and spectrum arguments, such as gradually replacing your personality with Napoleon's or transforming into Greta Garbo. These explore whether the self is a fixed entity or merely a pattern of atoms, with no "further fact" beyond physical and psychological continuity determining identity. Implications include rethinking morality, like viewing future selves as separate persons, affecting self-interest and decisions on issues like prison or abortion. I would note that this aligns with Buddhist ideas of no-self, as Parfit quotes from the Visuddhimagga: "The mental and the material are really here, / But here there is no human being to be found." It's a mind-bending framework that questions the core of human nature, making everyday concepts of "me" feel illusory.

**North-South Antipathies Endure Around the Globe** ([economist.com](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/north-south-antipathies-endure-around-the-globe))  
This article examines the persistent global phenomenon of north-south antipathies, where people judge, mock, or distrust those living above or below them on a map, using Belgium as a case study of internal tensions despite the country's prosperity. Observed over a quarter-century of reporting across four continents, these divisions reflect a quirky aspect of human behavior. The author notes, "People love to judge, mock or distrust those who live either above or below them on a map." I would observe that this applies within states too—like California or Florida—highlighting deep-seated splits in human nature between "Type A" and "Type B" mentalities, a timeless curiosity that underscores our tribal instincts.

**Sleep Is the Mate of Death** ([astralcodexten.substack.com](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/sleep-is-the-mate-of-death))  
This exploration of sleep's link to depression argues that symptoms in melancholic patients worsen after sleep and improve during wakefulness, with 70% of treatment-resistant cases alleviating after 24-48 hours of sleep deprivation—though effects fade upon sleeping. Drawing on Giulio Tononi's synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, it posits depression as a synaptic deficit, where sleep prunes synapses detrimentally, while wakefulness heals them. Referenced studies include MRI correlations showing reduced brain size and glucose use in depression, linked to fewer synapses (e.g., [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210895](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/210895)), and treatments like TMS increasing synaptic strength. Implications suggest sleep management could treat depression, with quotes like: "About 70% of cases of treatment-resistant depression go away completely if the patient stays awake long enough." I would note this resonates with how depression manifests variably, perhaps explaining why some feel shittiest in the morning—sleep renewing the gloom.

**Theses on Sleep** ([guzey.com](https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/#comfortable-modern-sleep-is-an-unnatural-superstimulus-sleepiness-just-like-hunger-is-normal))  
This essay challenges sleep consensus, arguing modern comfortable sleep is an unnatural superstimulus like junk food, leading to oversleeping, while sleepiness is normal like hunger. Key theses include bidirectional links between depression (oversleeping) and mania (sleep deprivation), benefits of acute deprivation (e.g., increasing BDNF), and no harm from reducing sleep by 1-2 hours long-term. Evidence includes a 2015 hunter-gatherer study (n=84) averaging 6.5 hours sleep, with 70% under 7 hours; a 2019 β1-adrenergic receptor mutation study showing carriers sleep 2 hours less without issues; and a 2014 brain surgery case where a patient adapted to 4 hours sleep post-operation. Conclusions posit unreliable sleep research (small-n, non-pre-registered) and no need for sleep in memory consolidation. Implications for health include potential adaptation to less sleep for productivity, with quotes like: "Comfortable modern sleep is an unnatural superstimulus. Sleep, like hunger, is normal." I would remark this flips the script on sleep deprivation, suggesting occasional all-nighters might be like beneficial fasting.

## Academic Research & Science

**PhilPapers Survey 2020** ([survey2020.philpeople.org](https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/5150))  
This survey of 556 professional philosophers reveals views on quantum mechanics interpretations, with 19.42% accepting or leaning toward many-worlds (17.09% exclusively), 21.94% for hidden-variables, 17.09% for collapse, and 12.77% for epistemic. Methodology involved multiple-answer options, with correlations like many-worlds showing strong positive ties (r=0.46, p\<0.0001). A high 24.28% were agnostic. Implications include many-worlds' prominence in debates on quantum reality, with 1 in 5 philosophers leaning toward it. I would point out this underscores philosophical uncertainty, as 24.28% agnosticism suggests ongoing debates without clear facts.

## Technology & Society

**Tech Companies Face a Fresh Crisis: Hiring** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/magazine/tech-company-recruiters.html))  
This article details tech recruiters' desperation amid talent shortages, with candidates holding power and often ignoring outreach. Recruiter Tiffany Dyba notes shifts from eager applicants sending gifts to current non-responses, saying, “They think we’re like used-car salesmen.” Data includes 1.7% tech unemployment (0.2% for cybersecurity) vs. 4% general. Implications highlight market imbalances driving up perks, like unlimited vacation. A colleague would observe this flips the script, with recruiters now chasing talent in a post-pandemic boom.

**The Factorio Mindset** ([thediff.co](https://www.thediff.co/p/the-factorio-mindset))  
Inspired by the game Factorio, where players automate resource gathering to refactor "spaghetti" factories into efficient systems, this piece posits a mindset of never leaving processes un-automated. Examples include automating email snippets post-play; economically, a 10x output from 1% scalable tasks. Implications for productivity: View tasks at 1,000x scale, though it risks ignoring human elements like jealousy. Quote: "You play Factorio in order to habituate yourself to never leaving a manual process un-automated." I would note it's like refactoring life—spot inefficiencies everywhere.

**The Economics of Data Businesses** ([pivotal.substack.com](https://pivotal.substack.com/p/economics-of-data-biz))  
Data businesses start slow with high upfront costs for a "minimum viable corpus," using methods like brute force (Google crawling) or give-to-get (Dun & Bradstreet). Scaling accelerates via loops (data quality, SEO), high NRR (\>100%), and 15:1 LTV/CAC. ZoomInfo's margins rose from 50% to 90% by 2021\. Implications for startups: High barriers yield defensibility, but slow growth deters VC. Quote: "Data businesses are hard to start, but they are also hard to kill." A buddy would say this explains why old firms like Equifax endure.

**Why Is LinkedIn So Cringe?** ([trungphan.substack.com](https://trungphan.substack.com/p/why-is-linkedin-so-cringe))  
LinkedIn's cringe stems from its model (65% Talent Solutions) rewarding HR-rockstar content like humblebrags and "broetry." Algorithm prioritizes dwell time, amplifying faux inspiration. 800M users, but HR holds power. Implications: Self-promotion dominates, potentially alienating but boosting ads (18-30% revenue). Quote: "Every platform has its royalty... On LinkedIn, it’s hiring managers, recruiters, and business owners." Someone would note it's virtue-signaling central.

**Why Simple Is Smart** ([theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/writing-tips-for-journalists-jargon-simplicity/621411/))  
Advice for journalists: Simplicity signals smarts, per Columbia study showing jargon masks insecurity. Be interesting (novelty \+ importance), write musically (repetition, pace), balance feedback. Quote: “When people feel insecure... they are more likely to use jargon." I would add this applies beyond journalism—clear writing wins.

**Most People Don’t Read Carefully or for Comprehension** ([jakeseliger.com](https://jakeseliger.com/2022/01/31/most-people-dont-read-carefully-or-for-comprehension/))  
Poor comprehension plagues students and public, with reactions trumping analysis. Dan Luu's thread notes nuanced messages fail in large orgs. Implications: Politics simplifies to slogans. Quote: “how few bits of information it’s possible to reliably convey." A pal would say it's why misunderstandings abound online.

## Economics & Development

**You Want to Have Educational Polarization on Your Side** ([marginalrevolution.com](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/02/you-want-to-have-educational-polarization-on-your-side.html))  
Align with analytically-inclined views, not majority educated opinions. Example: Ottawa truckers defend liberty but lack rigor. Quote: "Look for strong analytical abilities, and if you don’t see it, run the other way." Implications: Avoid nonsense for smarter politics.

**The Cutting Room Files, Part 4: The Future of Japan** ([zeihan.com](https://zeihan.com/the-cutting-room-files-part-4-the-future-of-japan/))  
Japan's island geography and resource scarcity drove empire-building, but post-WWII U.S. order enabled growth. Future: Flexible, with second-strongest navy. Quote: "Japan is … odd." Implications: Thrives in disorder via relocated industries.

**The Housing Theory of Everything** ([worksinprogress.co](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/))  
Housing shortages drive inequality (wealth to landowners), climate issues (sprawl, US 17.6t CO2/capita vs. Japan 10.3t), low productivity (8.9% GDP boost if restrictions eased), obesity (US 35% vs. Japan \<5%), fertility (10% price rise \= 1.3% birth drop). Studies: 2015 hunter-gatherer sleep (n=84). Quote: "Western housing shortages... drive inequality, climate change..." Implications: Fix housing for societal gains.

**Hanania Highlights, I** ([econlib.org](https://www.econlib.org/hanania-highlights-i/))  
U.S. foreign policy incoherent due to interest groups, not grand strategy. 80% retired generals in defense. Quote: "Decisions are made mostly on the basis of short-term political considerations..." Implications: Rethink IR as public choice.

## Reference & Curiosities

**Nine Familial Exterminations** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_familial_exterminations))  
Severe punishment in premodern China/Korea/Vietnam for treason, executing nine kin groups. Spared young, enslaved. Quote: Mencius's "being offspring is not a sin." I would note this echoes "Foundation's" family extinction—brutal deterrence.

**Turn On, Tune In, Veg Out** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/opinion/turn-on-tune-in-veg-out.html))  
Stephenson on "Star Wars" evolution: From accessible 1977 hit to geek-centric franchise needing supplements. Quote: "Twenty-eight years later... still has much to say about geeks." Implications: Media demands immersion.

**Pastor Resigns After Incorrectly Performing Thousands of Baptisms** ([nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/catholic-priest-baptisms-phoenix.html))  
Rev. Arango's "we baptize" invalidated thousands over 20 years, affecting sacraments. Diocese: "Maybe\!" on marriages. I would quip it's like a divine autocorrect fail—thousands unbaptized by one word.

## Politics & Current Events (2022)

**No, America Is Not on the Brink of a Civil War** ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/no-america-is-not-on-the-cusp-of-a-civil-war))  
Poll beliefs in "big lie" overstated due to trolling; low violence deaths contradict civil war fears. Quote: "We are not on the brink of a civil war." Implications: Posturing, not genuine divide.

**Why I Do Not Expect a Civil War in America (and What Does Worry Me)** ([chrisblattman.com](https://chrisblattman.com/2022/01/31/why-i-do-not-expect-a-civil-war-in-america-and-what-does-worry-me/))  
War costly, unlikely; worry erosion of norms, sporadic violence. Polity score fell to 5\. Quote: "Exceedingly unlikely, but... terrifying." Implications: Focus on institutions.

**How Did Russia Get So Big?** ([kamilkazani2.substack.com](https://kamilkazani2.substack.com/p/how-did-russia-get-so-big))  
River-based expansion for furs, shifting south post-1552 Kazan. 1682 tax data: Northern dominance. Quote: "Just 350 years ago... all of Russian taxpayers used to live in the towns of Arctic region." Implications: Resource-driven geopolitics.

**Putin’s Attack on Ukraine Is a Religious War** ([topsecretumbra.substack.com](https://topsecretumbra.substack.com/p/putins-attack-on-ukraine-is-a-religious))  
Invasion tied to Orthodox schism; 2019 OCU autocephaly seen as U.S.-backed. Quote: "Putin’s wholehearted embrace of religiously-infused nationalism... leaves WEIRDs befuddled." Implications: Faith fuels conflict.
