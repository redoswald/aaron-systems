## Academic Research & Science

**Amortized Planning with Transformers: Insights from Chess** ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04494))  
This paper evaluates transformers on chess as a planning task immune to memorization, using ChessBench—a dataset of 10 million games with 15 billion annotations from Stockfish 16\. Methodology involves supervised training of transformers up to 270 million parameters, comparing to Leela Chess Zero and AlphaZero. Key findings: Models predict action-values accurately, achieving a 2895 Lichess Elo (grandmaster level) without search, but perfect distillation of Stockfish's algorithm remains elusive. Implications suggest transformers generalize well in reasoning-heavy domains, with potential for strategic AI advancements. "Our largest models... achieve a surprisingly strong Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans (grandmaster level)."

Simulations model IVF embryo selection using SNP-based PGS (variance \>33%, up to 44% for IQ), incorporating process losses. Key findings: Selecting from 10 embryos yields \~9-10.87 IQ points (0.62 SD); real-world models like Tan et al (3 eggs, 50% normality) give \~0.38 points. Multiple traits add \+3.7-5.3 SD with correlations. Methodology: R simulations with order statistics, normal distributions, GWAS data (e.g., Benyamin et al 2014, ~~1800 SNPs). Cost-benefit: Marginal IVF cost $1,500/embryo; lifetime IQ value $6,000-15,000/point. Data: Optimal at 24 embryos (~~$80k). Implications: Feasible gains for polygenic traits like IQ, height, BMI; extends to diseases, urging ethical scaling.

Methodology: Historical BMI trends (e.g., Kromlos 2010), inter-country omega-6 data (Micha 2014), RCTs. Conclusions: No clear harm, potential benefits; implications favor vegetable oils over saturated fats, but avoid overeating processed foods. "Reducing saturated fat (replacing with polyunsaturated fats) reduced cardiovascular events by 21%."
